# Universal `--compare` Mode

Side-by-side multi-country comparison for relocation, investment, and "where should I move/buy?" decisions. Leverages all 87 country playbooks at once.

**Snapshot**: May 2026 (Tier-5 additions).

## When to use

Trigger `--compare` when the user is **not committing to a single address** but instead asking:
- "Where should I move from FR?" — compare candidate countries
- "Spain or Portugal for golden-visa replacement?" — compare 2-5 countries head-to-head
- "Cheapest entry market in EU for €200k?" — compare on a metric
- "Where can I retire on €2,500/mo?" — compare with `--retirement` overlay

## Invocation

```
/property-deep-dive --compare=es,pt,it [--criteria=<list>] [--journey=<type>] [--budget=<amount>]
/property-deep-dive --compare=eu --top=10 --criteria=tax,price,visa
/property-deep-dive --compare --rank=tax-friendly --rank=climate-stable
```

## Universal contract

For each country in the comparison set, return:
1. **One row per country** with the requested criteria

3. **Overall verdict per user-stated objective**
4. **Ranked shortlist** (top 3 by composite score)

## Anti-hallucination

- **Only compare countries already in the skill** (`countries/<iso2>/playbook.md` exists). Refuse to compare unsupported countries.
- **Use the playbook values as authoritative** — do not retrieve fresh data per-country during a `--compare` run; trust the latest playbook refresh
- **Date-stamp every cell** — comparison output must show "as of <playbook last-update>" per row
- **Surface playbook confidence** — if any country has LOW confidence, flag it in the row

## Reverse mode (`--match`)

`--match` is `--compare` pointed **backwards**: instead of naming the countries and comparing them, the user states their **constraints** (cohort + budget + criteria) and the skill returns a **ranked shortlist of best-fit countries** from the supported corpus. It is an address-less **discovery mode**, not a per-address section — most buyers know their constraints, not their candidate countries.

It reuses this file's precomputed verdict shortcuts + `config/_visa-programs.json` + the per-playbook values as the authoritative data layer — it never invents a score.

### Invocation

```
/property-deep-dive --match --cohort=<type> [--budget=<amount>] --criteria=<list> [--top=N] [--region=<shortcut>] [--exclude=<iso2,...>] [--must=<hard-filter,...>]
```

Examples:

- `--match --cohort=retiree --budget=300k --criteria=tax,climate,healthcare,visa --top=5`
- `--match --cohort=investor --criteria=yield,acquisition-cost,annual-carry --region=eu --must=foreign-buyer-open`
- `--match --cohort=digital-nomad --budget=150k --criteria=connectivity,visa,tax,cost-of-living`

`--top` defaults to **5**. `--region` reuses the comparison-set shortcuts above. The Skip-list (sanctions/conflict states etc.) is always excluded.

### Cohorts + default weight vectors

Cohorts map to existing overlays (no new data). Weights are the cohort default when the user doesn't override; **always shown in the output** (the weighting is the most opinion-laden part — never hide it).

| Cohort | Default weights (sum 100) |
|---|---|
| `retiree` | health 25 · tax 20 · climate 20 · cost-of-living 15 · visa 15 · safety 5 |
| `digital-nomad` | visa 25 · connectivity 20 · tax 20 · cost-of-living 20 · health 15 |
| `investor` | yield 35 · acquisition-cost 20 · annual-carry 15 · exit/CGT 15 · fx 15 |
| `family` | schools 30 · safety 25 · health 20 · cost-of-living 15 · climate 10 |
| `foreign-buyer` | foreign-buyer-access 25 · acquisition-cost 20 · closing/remote 20 · cost-of-living 15 · climate 10 · visa 10 |
| `lifestyle` | climate 30 · cost-of-living 25 · safety 20 · connectivity 15 · health 10 |

### Criteria → data source

| Criterion | Pre-ranked here? | Source |
|---|---|---|
| acquisition-cost | ✅ | § lowest/highest acquisition cost (also the budget hard-filter) |
| annual-carry | ✅ | § lowest/highest annual carry |
| tax | ✅ (partial) | § cleanest/steepest 2026 tax reforms + playbook `--tax` |
| foreign-buyer | ✅ | § most-friendly / highest-friction (also a hard filter) |
| fx | ✅ | § most/least FX-stable for €-buyers |
| visa | ✅ | `config/_visa-programs.json` (also a `--must` hard filter) |
| healthcare | ⚠️ curated | enrollment-timeline tiers (`digital-nomad-healthcare.md` → `config/_match-extracted.json`, ~10 countries) — MEDIUM |
| yield · climate · schools · safety · connectivity · cost-of-living | ❌ no stored value | **LOW / data-not-available** — no per-country value exists in the repo (computed live per-query). Only score a country if its playbook holds a *discrete, citable value*; descriptive prose is NOT a value — see the No-data rule below |

### Execution

1. **Resolve** the candidate set (`--region` shortcut or all supported countries) minus `--exclude` and the Skip-list.
2. **Hard-filter (eliminate)** — drop candidates that fail a pass/fail gate: foreign-buyer access, budget feasibility (entry = segment-typical €/m² × ~60 m²; a hard floor only with `--must=budget`, else a soft signal), and any `--must=` gate (visa availability via `_visa-programs.json`, FX, residency).
3. **Score** each survivor per criterion. Rank-based band: with `K` ranked countries, rank `r` → `band = round(100 × (K − r + 1) / K)` (#1 = 100). Graded hard-derived signals map to `{open 100 / restricted 60 / barred 0}`.
4. **Composite** = `Σ(wᵢ × bandᵢ) / Σ(wᵢ for criteria with data)`. A criterion with no grounded value for a country is **dropped from both numerator and denominator** — missing data must neither help nor penalise; footnote the drop.
5. **Render** the top-N shortlist + per-criterion breakdown + why each ranked where + confidence + a CTA to `--compare` the shortlist.

**No-data rule (grounding gate).** A criterion is *grounded* only by a named list position in this file or a **discrete, dated playbook value** (a stated tier, statistic, or rank) — **never** by descriptive prose ("mild climate", "good schools"). For a `pending`/live criterion, if the playbook holds no discrete value, render the cell `—` and **drop the criterion from that country's composite** (step 4). Never convert adjectives into a band or score. The generator never fabricates a pending criterion — the runtime extractor must not either. A `—` cell is the correct, expected output, not a failure.

### Output template

```markdown
## Country Match — <cohort>, budget <amount>, criteria <list>

**Candidates**: <N supported>   **After hard filters**: <M>   **Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD> (playbook last-refresh)

### Hard filters (eliminations)
- foreign-buyer-open → dropped CA, AU, NZ, TH(land), KW…
- budget ≥ entry → dropped MC, CH, SG(non-res)…

### Ranked shortlist (top N)
🥇 1. PT — 84/100 · open (NIF only), low carry, IFICI tax, D7 visa  [climate/health: no data → dropped]
🥈 2. GR — 80/100 · €800k/€400k golden visa; 🚩 zone-dependent thresholds
🥉 3. ES — 78/100 · open (NIE), deep market; ⚠️ acquisition cost ~10-13%

### Per-criterion breakdown
| Country | Tax | Climate | Health | Visa | Acq.cost | Composite |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PT | 🟢 | — | — | 🟢 | 🟡 | 84 |

`—` = no grounded value → dropped from the composite (No-data rule); never a guessed band. (PT's climate + healthcare are `pending-extraction`, so they render `—`, not 🟢.)

### Weighting & confidence
- Weights: <cohort default | user-set> — shown in full
- Confidence: <HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW>. **If a country's grounded criteria sum to <50% of its cohort weight, mark its composite `LOW — partial` + show the surviving-weight %** — e.g. a `family` query leans on schools + safety (both unstored), so most weight drops and the composite is low-trust. Healthcare runs MEDIUM (curated, ~10 countries); the other five pending criteria are LOW / data-not-available.
- Dropped (no data): <country:criterion …> — list every `—` cell.

### Next step
→ Deep-compare:  /property-deep-dive --compare=pt,gr,es,cy,it --tax --climate --retirement
→ Full brief:    /property-deep-dive <PT address> --all
```

### Anti-hallucination (inherits the four rules above + 3 additions)

The four `--compare` rules apply verbatim (supported countries only · playbook/precomputed values are authoritative, no fresh per-country fetch · date-stamp · surface LOW confidence). Plus:

5. **No fabricated composite scores** — every band traces to a named list position (§ above) or a dated playbook value; show the inputs. A criterion with no grounded source for a country is excluded from that country's composite, never guessed.
6. **Structural shortlist, not advice** — `--match` ranks *documented attributes against stated constraints*. It is not financial / immigration / tax advice; weights are inherently subjective. See `DISCLAIMER.md`.
7. **Show the weighting** — the cohort default (or user) weights are always printed; the user must be able to see why #1 beat #2.

If hard filters eliminate everything, say so and suggest relaxing a `--must=`. If fewer than 3 survive, return them but flag the thin set.

### Worked example — retiree, €300k, criteria tax+climate+healthcare+visa

Illustrative (numbers are from individual playbooks at last refresh — check each `**Last verified**:` before quoting):

- **Hard filters**: foreign-buyer-open (drops CA / AU / NZ established-home bans); budget ≥ entry (€300k clears PT/GR/ES/CY/IT; drops MC/CH).
- **Result**: a PT-led Mediterranean shortlist — PT (open + IFICI + D7), GR (golden-visa + climate), ES (deep market, higher acquisition cost ~10-13%), CY (low carry, 🚩 north-title), IT (2%-resident vs 9%-non-resident cadastral 🚩). Each row carries its per-criterion band + the playbook date; tax/fx/acquisition-cost/foreign-buyer/visa are HIGH (pre-ranked), climate/healthcare run MEDIUM until the Phase-2 index.

### Phase 2 — `config/_match-index.json` (built)

`config/_match-index.json` precomputes, **per country, the rank/band + `src` provenance** for the criteria this file already ranks (acquisition-cost, annual-carry, fx, foreign-buyer, visa, tax) plus the three hard-filter booleans (`foreign-buyer-open`, `no-fx-risk`, `property-residency-route`). It is **generated deterministically** from this file's ranked lists + `config/_visa-programs.json` by `scripts/render-match-index.py` (regenerate on change; CI `--check` in `.github/workflows/match-index-audit.yml` keeps it in sync; `scripts/render-match-index-test.py` covers it). **Reverse mode consumes it**: read each survivor's band + hard-filter from the index when present; a country absent from the index (the lists don't cover all 126) or a criterion marked `pending-extraction` is resolved live **only from a discrete playbook value** (No-data rule) — absent that it renders `—` (LOW / data-not-available), never a MEDIUM band from prose.

Of the seven judgement-heavy criteria, **only `healthcare` has a stored, citable per-country signal** (public-system enrollment timeline in `digital-nomad-healthcare.md`). It is curated into `config/_match-extracted.json` (~10 countries — each with source + verbatim evidence + tier) and merged into the index at MEDIUM confidence. The other six — yield, climate, safety, connectivity, schools, cost-of-living — have **no stored per-country value**: the skill computes them live/per-query from primary sources *by design* (so they never go stale), so pre-baking them into a static index would decay or fabricate. They stay `{"status": "pending-extraction"}`: at query time each is scored **only if the playbook holds a discrete value** (No-data rule) — otherwise rendered `—` and dropped, never a MEDIUM band invented from prose. The generator **never fabricates** a pending criterion. Full design + the feasibility finding: `_local/scope-match-section.md`.

🥇 **PH** for English-fluent retiree on USD income who accepts condo-only ownership and tropical-storm risk
🥈 **TH** for retiree who wants LTR-tier tax structure and is comfortable with leasehold-house workaround (30-yr renewable)
🥉 **JP** for retiree wanting freehold ownership + rule-of-law, with capital base willing to absorb low rental yield + ageing-society demographic headwind

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — visa thresholds + tax rates verified per individual playbooks Q2 2026; long-term retirement viability is a 20-year bet that no playbook can fully de-risk.

### Example B — AE vs IL vs CY for tax-residence pivot

| Metric | AE | IL | CY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal income tax | 0% (corporate 9% above AED 375k) | Progressive to 47% + 3% surtax | Progressive to 35%; SDC abolished 1 Jan 2026 |
| CGT on resale | 0% | 25-50% Mas Shevach (NR uplift) | Exempt above raised thresholds (2026 reform) |
| Property tax annual | None (5% housing fee on rental only) | Arnona muni | Municipal small (national IPT abolished 2017) |
| Foreign ownership | Designated freehold zones only | de-facto leasehold (RMI 93% state land) | Full freehold |
| Visa pathway | Golden Visa AED 2M property, 10y | Aliyah (Jewish-only) — closed pathway for non-Jews | PR €300k property |
| Geopolitical risk | Regional but low-impact internally | High (war + missile risk) | Cyprus problem: TRNC north title trap |

🥇 **CY** for clean tax-residence pivot with EU-passport upside (after long stay) + post-2026 reform clarity
🥈 **AE** for fast-track 10-yr Golden Visa + zero income tax — at cost of EU access and lower liquidity in resale
🥉 **IL** only for Jewish applicants (Aliyah-eligible) willing to accept war-zone insurance via Karnit + leasehold dominant tenure

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — CY 2026 tax-reform details still being clarified by Inland Revenue; AE Golden Visa thresholds stable since 2022; IL war-risk is dynamic.

### Example C — CO vs MX vs PA for LATAM digital-nomad/investor

| Metric | CO | MX | PA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foreign-buyer access | Open | Fideicomiso required in 50km coast / 100km border | Open except 10km border (constitutional) |
| Total acquisition cost | ~5-6% | ~6-8% (incl. fideicomiso setup) | ~5-6% |
| Annual carry | Predial municipio + estrato | Predial municipio | IBI escalating brackets |
| CGT | 15% ganancia ocasional | 25-35% on gain (or 25% gross option) | 3% + 10% capital gains structure |
| Digital-nomad/RBI route | Migratorio M (350× SMLMV) | RNE / Temporary Resident | Friendly Nations USD 200k / Qualified Investor USD 300k |
| Climate | Andean mild | Coastal hurricane belt (Pacific + Caribbean) | Caribbean+Pacific dual-coast hurricane fringe |
| FX risk | COP EM-volatile | MXN EM-volatile | USD-denominated economy (no FX risk for USD buyers) |

🥇 **PA** for USD-base investor wanting simplest visa + zero FX risk + Friendly Nations or Qualified Investor pathway
🥈 **CO** for cheaper entry, moderate climate, but 2026 catastro-multipropósito rollout creates assessed-value uncertainty
🥉 **MX** for buyer accepting fideicomiso friction in exchange for deeper market and proximity to US

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — PA Qualified Investor program threshold verified Q1 2026; CO catastro reform cadence per municipio is uneven.

### Example D — GE vs PT vs CY for EU-adjacent low-tax base

| Metric | GE | PT | CY |
|---|---|---|---|
| EU member? | NO (EU-adjacent / candidate) | YES | YES |
| Foreign-buyer access | Open, fastest registration globally (<1 day) | Open (NIF only) | Open |
| Acquisition cost | ~0.1-0.5% | ~7-8% (IMT + stamp + notary) | ~8-10% |
| Annual property tax | Income-gated (only above GEL 40k household income) | IMI 0.3-0.45% | Municipal small |
| CGT | None after 2-yr hold | 28% non-residents (50% inclusion residents) | Exempt above raised 2026 thresholds |
| Tax residency draw | Territorial — 1% small-business / 20% personal | IFICI replaced NHR (narrower) 2024+ | 60-day rule + non-dom 17 years |
| Visa | Investor USD 300k property | D7/D8 (income-based, not property) | PR €300k property |
| Risk | Russia border + currency exposure (GEL) | EU stability | TRNC title trap; banking-sector overhang |

🥇 **CY** for EU-passport-track tax-residence with strongest 2026 reform tailwind
🥈 **PT** for EU base prioritising rule-of-law over tax minimisation (post-NHR closure)
🥉 **GE** for ultra-fast non-EU base with lowest acquisition friction and territorial-tax structure — at cost of EU access and proximity to active conflict zone

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — GE political stability and visa-program continuity carry higher-than-EU uncertainty; PT IFICI implementation still settling; CY 2026 reform clarifications ongoing.

### Example E — SG vs HK vs MO for East-Asian financial-hub base

| Metric | SG | HK | MO |
|---|---|---|---|
| EU member? | NO (city-state) | NO (HK SAR China) | NO (MO SAR China) |
| Foreign-buyer access | Strata only without SLA approval; **ABSD 60% non-resident** | Open + **BSD 15% non-PR + AVD up to 4.25%** | Open but Investment Residence SUSPENDED 2007 |
| Total acquisition cost | **65-70%+ for non-residents** (BSD + ABSD + agent + legal); **3-7% citizen** | ~20-25% non-PR (AVD + BSD 15%); ~5-10% PR | ~5-8% (post-stamp duty + agent) |
| Annual property tax | Property Tax 0-23% on AV (owner-occupier) / up to 32% non-occupied | Rates ~5% on Rateable Value + Property Tax 15% on rental | None on residential; 6-10% Property Tax on rental net |
| CGT | NONE | NONE for individuals (Profits Tax doesn't apply to personal capital gains) | NONE on personal property gain |
| Personal income tax | Resident 0-22% progressive; foreign-source generally NOT taxed in SG | Salaries Tax 2-17% progressive / 15% standard; territorial — HK-source only | Macao Professional Tax territorial — MO-source only |
| Currency | SGD MAS-managed-float | HKD-USD peg LERS 7.75-7.85 (HKMA) | MOP-HKD-USD double peg |
| Visa pathway via property | None (GIP S$10M/S$25M/S$200M only) | **CIES reactivated Mar 2024** HK$30M + ≤HK$10M residential | **SUSPENDED 2007** — Talent Programme NOT property-linked |
| Climate | Equatorial 24-32°C year-round (Changi best-in-world airport) | Subtropical 14-33°C; typhoon season Jul-Oct | Subtropical 14-32°C; typhoon + post-Hato 2017 storm-surge reforms |

🥇 **HK** for high-net-worth wanting investment-track residency via property (CIES reactivated Mar 2024); accept Article 23 (NSL) sentiment factor and partial post-2020 expat outflow recovery
🥈 **SG** for highest-quality administrative environment + best-in-world airport + lowest CGT/PIT structure for foreign-source income — at cost of **ABSD 60% non-resident** which restructures any property-purchase economics into citizen-class transaction
🥉 **MO** only for those with a non-property residence pathway (Talent Programme, family-unification) — Investment Residence has been SUSPENDED since 2007

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — HK CIES revival details still being clarified by ImmD post-Mar 2024; SG ABSD 60% verified at IRAS but all-in stamp-duty stack drift on cooling-measure cycles; MO Talent Programme 2024 scope still being defined by IPIM. Verify all thresholds at issuing authority.

### Example F — KR vs TW for East-Asian remote-work base

| Metric | KR | TW |
|---|---|---|
| Foreign-buyer access | Open (Foreigner's Land Acquisition Act notification only) | Reciprocity-list-based — verify BOCA list per nationality |
| Total acquisition cost | ~6-8% (acquisition tax 1-3% sliding by price + 0.2% local + agent + reg fee) | ~6-8% (deed tax 6% + agent 1-2% + reg) |
| Annual carry | jaesanse 0.1-0.4% + comprehensive real estate tax 종부세 0.5-5% on multi-home owners | House Tax 1.5-3.6% by use + Land Value Tax 1-5.5% |
| CGT | Separate 6-45% + multi-home top rate up to 75% | AMT regime on foreign-source >NT$7M; 6% surtax on certain investment income |
| Personal income tax | Worldwide for residents (>183 days); progressive 6-45%; **5/10-yr foreign-source exemption** for newly-resident foreign workers (PIT Act Art. 18-2) | Worldwide for residents (>183 days); progressive 5-40% |
| Visa pathway | **F-2 Investor (₩600M, 5yr) → F-5 PR**; F-4 Korean diaspora; **Workation Visa F-1-D (Jan 2024)** | **Gold Card** 4-yr work + residency (no investment); APRC after 5yr; Plum Blossom long-stay |
| Climate | Cold continental — Seoul -5/+3°C winter, 26-31°C summer; aging society | Tropical-subtropical; Taipei 14-20°C winter, 28-32°C summer; **2024 Hualien M7.4 earthquake** |
| Internet | Gigabit fiber norm (KT/SK/LG); ranked top globally on most digital metrics | Gigabit FTTH norm (Chunghwa, Taiwan Mobile) |

🥇 **TW** for remote-worker via **Gold Card** (no investment threshold) — 8 high-skill categories + 4-yr residency leading to APRC; lower COL than KR for English-medium services
🥈 **KR** for those targeting F-2/F-5 PR via investment OR for Korean-diaspora F-4 holders; multi-home tax (종부세 0.5-5%) is material structural drag for portfolio buyers

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — KR Workation Visa F-1-D launched Jan 2024 (verify HiKorea); TW Gold Card category list updates periodically (verify NIA/BOCA); TW 2024 Hualien M7.4 disclosure rules still settling.

### Example G — AD vs MC vs LI for European-microstate residence

| Metric | AD | MC | LI |
|---|---|---|---|
| EU member? | NO (Monetary Treaty 2011, EUR) | NO (Monetary Treaty, EUR) | NO (EEA member; CHF currency union with CH) |
| Schengen | NO | YES (Schengen via FR) | YES (via 2011 extension) |
| Personal income tax | IRPF 0/5/10% — **lowest in Western Europe** | **NONE** (except FR nationals via 1963 Convention) | ~2.5-22.4% combined federal + commune (among lowest CH-area) |
| CGT | 10% within IRPF | NONE | Within personal-tax regime |
| Acquisition cost | ~3-5% (ITP 4% + notari + Govern registration) | ~10-12% (4.5% droits + notary + agent + 20% TVA on agent) | ~5-7% (Handänderungssteuer ~2% + commune + Grundbuchamt) |
| Visa pathway | **Residència Passiva ~€600k** OR €350k + €50k AFA; passive ≥90d/yr | **Carte temporaire** ~€500k bank deposit + property practitioner | **Quota-based lottery** (~28 EEA + ~17 third-country/year); Personal Residence Programme rare petition only |
| Naturalisation | 20 yrs (longest in Western Europe) | 10 yrs after privilégiée; rare in practice | 10 yrs (after surrendering prior citizenship — verify with Ausländer- und Passamt) |
| Population | ~85k (~75% non-Andorran) | ~38k (~70% non-Monégasque) | ~40k |
| Climate | Alpine 0-8°C winter, 18-25°C summer | Mediterranean 8-15°C winter, 24-29°C summer (mildest of three) | Alpine 0-5°C winter, 18-24°C summer |
| Healthcare | CASS mandatory; cross-border to FR/ES | Caisses Sociales + CHPG; cross-border to FR/IT | KVG-equivalent; cross-border to CH |

🥇 **MC** for ultra-high-net-worth wanting **NO PIT/CGT** + Mediterranean climate + Schengen access — at cost of highest COL globally and strict Sûreté Publique due-diligence
🥈 **AD** for HNWI accepting alpine isolation in exchange for IRPF 0/5/10% (lowest in Western Europe) and lowest acquisition cost of the three; **20yr naturalisation** is the long-game catch
🥉 **LI** only for lottery-winning EEA candidates or rare Personal Residence Programme petitioners; CH-integrated practice for healthcare/banking

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — AD Llei 26/2024 STR + parish quotas still rolling out per parròquia; MC Sûreté Publique due-diligence threshold drift on FX cycles; LI quota allocation publicly disclosed annually but qualifying-criteria opaque. Verify all thresholds at issuing authority.

### Example H — MD vs UA-adjacent EU-candidates for low-COL Eastern European base

| Metric | MD | (cross-reference: GE / RS / ME) |
|---|---|---|
| EU candidate? | YES (Jun 2022) | GE Mar 2024 (associate path); RS/ME accession negotiations open |
| COL | **Lowest in Europe** (Numbeo 2024-2026) | GE/RS/ME mid-low |
| Personal income tax | Flat 12% (one of lowest in Europe) | GE territorial-leaning; RS 10-25% progressive; ME 9-15% progressive |
| Acquisition cost | ~2-4% (notary + State Registration Chamber) | GE 0.1-0.5% (lowest globally); RS 5-7%; ME 5-7% |
| Foreign-buyer access | Open for buildings + non-agricultural land | All three open |
| Visa pathway | **Investor Residency Law 200/2010** — €250k 5yr → naturalisation 8yr | GE Investor Residency USD 300k; RS/ME standard residence |
| Romanian-citizenship-by-descent → EU passport | YES (widely used) | NO equivalent |
| Schengen | NO | NO (all three) |
| Currency | MDL float | GEL float; RSD managed; EUR (ME) |
| Internet | Gigabit fiber Moldtelecom + Orange MD + StarNet (one of fastest fiber penetrations in Eastern Europe) | GE Magticom/Silknet good; RS strong; ME variable |
| Transnistria | **Excluded from due-diligence scope** | N/A |

🥇 **MD** for cheapest Europe COL + flat 12% PIT + Romanian-citizenship-by-descent EU-passport optionality + gigabit fiber norm — at cost of: NO Schengen, NO formal Digital Nomad Visa as of 2026, geographic isolation, Russian-language-spillover political-risk overlay
- Cross-reference GE for similar low-COL Eurasian base with faster registration but no EU candidacy
- Cross-reference RS/ME for EU-candidate Western Balkans alternatives with broader expat networks

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — MD CBI ended via Law 100/2020 (verified at SFS/Govt portal); Investor Residency Law 200/2010 thresholds verified per Investment Agency Moldova. Romanian-citizenship-by-descent path is widely used but ANC processing times have stretched 2022-2026. Transnistria-scope exclusion is a hard rule for any due-diligence on real-estate east of Dniester.

### Example I — QA vs SA vs AE for GCC tax-residence base

| Metric | QA | SA | AE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal income tax | **NONE** for individuals (corporate ~10%) | **NONE** for individuals (Saudi Zakat 2.5% / corporate 20% non-Saudi) | **NONE** for individuals (corporate 9% above AED 375k) |
| CGT on resale | NONE | NONE | NONE |
| Foreign-buyer access | Designated freehold zones only (Pearl-Qatar / West Bay Lagoon / Lusail) | Mecca/Medina constitutional Muslim-only; Premium Residency Real-Estate-Owner SAR 4M minimum | Designated freehold zones only (Dubai Designated Areas + Abu Dhabi investment zones) |
| Visa pathway | **Investor Residency Law 21/2018 ≥QAR 730k → 5yr renewable**; PR Law 10/2018 ≥QAR 1M (capped ~100/yr); **NO CBI** | **Premium Residency Vision 2030** SAR 800k one-time / SAR 100k/yr / SAR 4M Real-Estate-Owner | **Golden Visa AED 2M property → 10yr renewable** |
| Population | ~3.05M (12% Qatari + 88% expat) | ~36.4M (63% Saudi + 37% expat) | ~10.2M (~88% expat) |
| Currency | QAR pegged USD 3.64 since Jul 2001 | SAR pegged USD 3.75 since Jun 1986 | AED pegged USD 3.6725 |
| Climate | 18-42°C; **summer 45°C+ + sandstorms + 2018/2021/2024 Doha storm-surge floods** | 12-45°C interior; **50°C+ summer + sandstorms + 2009/2011 Jeddah catastrophic floods + drought** | 18-42°C; **summer 45°C+ near-uninhabitable May-Sep** |
| Healthcare | HMC public + private (Aspetar / Sidra / Doha Clinic) | MOH + mandatory CCHI for expats + private (JCI-accredited) | Mandatory private DHA / DOH |
| Mega-project pull | FIFA World Cup 2022 legacy + Lusail | Vision 2030: NEOM / Qiddiya / Diriyah / Red Sea / AlUla / Roshn | Established freehold zones + Expo 2020 legacy |

🥇 **AE** for fastest visa pathway (Golden Visa AED 2M → 10yr) + most established freehold-zone economics + best diversification
🥈 **QA** for cleaner cap on foreign population pressure + Investor Residency floor lower (QAR 730k) than SA / AE Golden Visa + sustainable 5yr renewable
🥉 **SA** only for Vision 2030 mega-project economic-pull (NEOM / Red Sea) — but Real-Estate-Owner SAR 4M threshold is the steepest of the three, and Mecca/Medina Muslim-only restriction matters for non-Muslim retirees

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — QA Investor Residency thresholds verified Q1 2026 at MoI; SA Premium Residency Vision 2030 tiers actively being refined by Premium Residency Center; AE Golden Visa stable since 2022. Verify all three with issuing authority before action.

### Example J — AM vs AZ for Caucasus base + Russian-relocant wave dynamics

| Metric | AM | AZ |
|---|---|---|
| EU member? | NO (CSTO suspension Feb 2024 — geopolitical pivot in flight) | NO |
| Foreign-buyer access | Open (equal rights non-citizens per Land Code Art. 4); agricultural and protected land restricted | Open subject to TRP / Strategic Investor; agricultural and border-zone restricted |
| Total acquisition cost | ~3-5% (State Registry + notary + agent) | ~5-8% (registration + notary + agent) |
| Annual carry | Sliding 0-1% on cadastre value, AMD 3M threshold exempt | Modest property tax sliding by region |
| CGT | Within personal-tax regime (flat 21% PIT 2026 on residents) | Within progressive 14-25% PIT |

| Geopolitics | **Post-2020/2023 Karabakh war + ~120k displaced Sep 2023 + CSTO suspension Feb 2024**; Russian-relocant wave 2022-24 (~50% peak Yerevan appreciation) | **2020+2023 Karabakh + East Zangezur reintegration** (ANAMA de-mining required); oil-revenue stabilized via SOFAZ |
| Diaspora | ~7M global (US ~1M, RU ~2M, FR/AR/LB/IR) — Art. 13 descent path | Smaller diaspora; closer to TR economically |
| Internet | Beeline / VivaCell / Ucom fiber gigabit Yerevan | Azercell / Bakcell / Nar 5G Baku |

🥇 **AM** for Armenian-diaspora applicants (Art. 13 descent streamlined; dual since 2007) or for Yerevan-tech base accepting Russian-relocant-wave reversion-risk; appreciation 2022-24 has materially reset price floor higher than pre-war base
🥈 **AZ** for foreign investor accepting **dual-citizenship LIMITED** caveat in exchange for very-low-crime + oil-revenue economic stability + lower cost of living than AM Yerevan post-2022

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — AM Land Code Art. 4 verified; AM Russian-relocant wave 2022-24 documented by NSS / CBA but reversion timing uncertain; AZ Strategic Investor Visa AZN 540k threshold verified at State Migration Service; East Zangezur ANAMA de-mining cert + AZ-citizen-priority housing in newly-reintegrated zones still being clarified.

| Visa pathway | **Investor Visa USD 30k BUSINESS** (NOT real-estate exclusively) / **Rentista USD 1,500/mo passive** | **Pensioner Visa USD 1,500/mo** / **Investor Visa USD 42,500** (~100×SBU 2026 SBU USD 470/mo) | **SET 1186/2023 reformed PR** — formerly USD 5,200 → now USD 70k SUACE business OR active SET RUC |
| Path to citizenship | PR 3yr → passport 2yr PR | Naturalization 3yr PR | Citizenship 3yr continuous PR |
| Currency | PEN BCRP-managed; USD-pricing common Lima Miraflores | **USD-dollarized since 2000** — no native currency | PYG BCP-managed; USD widely accepted Asunción |

| Energy | Standard | Standard | **Itaipú/Yacyretá #2 net electricity exporter** — cheap energy attracts data centers |

🥇 **PY** for **territorial PIT + lowest acquisition cost + cheap energy** (Itaipú/Yacyretá) + USD 70k SUACE pathway; accept PYG FX volatility + flood/drought climate risk
🥈 **EC** for **Pensioner USD 1,500/mo** (lowest threshold of three) + **Cuenca established US/CA retiree hub** + USD-dollarized FX simplicity; accept 2024 Internal Armed Conflict Declaration overhang on coastal cities

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — PY Resolución SET 1186/2023 reform verified at SET; EC Internal Armed Conflict Declaration political-economy overhang dynamic 2024-2026; PE Constitution Art. 71 border-zone restriction stable; all three SBU/SUACE/MIGRACIONES thresholds drift annually — verify at issuing authority.

### Example L — TN vs MA vs EG for North African / Mediterranean retirement

| Foreign-buyer access | Open via Investor Residence Permit ≥TND 1M; Office des Changes documentation | Only `titré` (registered) properties safely transferable to foreigners; agricultural barred | Max 2 properties × 4,000 m² total; Sinai/Suez excluded |
| Total acquisition cost | ~10-15% (5% droits + 1% conservation foncière + agent) | ~5-8% (cleaner stack) | ~5-7% formal but most properties unregistered |
| Pension tax | Worldwide resident progressive 0-35%; **80% abatement on foreign pension transferred permanently in TND** (Art. 36 Code IRPP — verify) | Foreign pensions: **80% abatement if transferred permanently in DH** (Art. 76 CGI) | Foreign-source pension generally not taxed by EG (territorial application varies) |
| Visa pathway | Investor Residence Permit ≥TND 1M (~USD 320k); **Tunisia Investor Visa drafted 2024 NOT gazetted** | Carte de Séjour (long-stay) standard residence permit | **Investment Law 160/2023 PR** USD 250k cash deposit → permanent residency |
| Citizenship | 5yr continuous PR + Arabic; dual since 2014 | 5yr continuous PR | Investment Law 160/2023 path |
| Population | ~12.07M (Tunis Metro ~2.7M, Sfax ~1M, Sousse ~290k, Djerba ~165k) | ~37M | ~110M |
| Climate | Tunis Mediterranean 11-32°C; **2018 Cap Bon floods + 2023-24 record drought + APAL coastal erosion** | Marrakech 18-22°C winter; Atlantic coast cooler | Hurghada/Sahel 18-35°C; very dry; summer extreme |

| Healthcare | CNAM + private (French-system); **medical-tourism destination** | AMO (2024-2026 expansion) + private (French-system) | New Universal Health Insurance (2018 phased); medivac for serious cases |
| FX repatriation | Office des Changes documentation required (similar MA-style friction) | Office des Changes mandatory for repatriation | Form 4 mandatory for USD repatriation — without it, EGP-only exit during devaluation |
| Macro | **IMF EFF program SUSPENDED Mar 2024** | Stable | EGP devaluation cycles 2022-2024 |

🥇 **MA** for cleanest acquisition stack + 80% abatement on foreign pension + established FR/UK/DE retiree communities (Marrakech / Essaouira / Tangier / Agadir); accept agricultural-land bar + `titré`-only-safely-transferable rule
🥈 **TN** for **medical-tourism healthcare quality + French-system standards** + 80% abatement on foreign pension under Art. 36 Code IRPP (verify); accept IMF EFF Mar 2024 suspension overhang + post-2021 constitutional revision political-economy risk
🥉 **EG** only with **Form 4 documented at purchase** for clean USD repatriation — without it, EGP-only exit during devaluation = catastrophic; **Sinai/Suez excluded** for foreigners; max 2 properties × 4,000 m² total

**Confidence**: MEDIUM — TN Code IRPP Art. 36 80% abatement structure parallels MA Art. 76 CGI but verify with Direction Générale des Impôts; TN IMF EFF Mar 2024 suspension is structural FX overhang; MA Art. 76 CGI verified; EG Investment Law 160/2023 thresholds verified but Form 4 + currency-control risks remain material.

### Example M — OM vs BH vs KW vs JO for non-AE/QA/SA GCC + Levant residency-by-property

## Limitations

- **Not predictive**: comparison is current-state, not 5-year-forward
- **Not personalized**: doesn't know user's age, citizenship, financial profile — those go via `--journey=<type>` overlay
- **Doesn't replace local advice**: every shortlist needs a local notary/lawyer/tax adviser before committing
