## Family-friendliness composite signals

Strongest (parental leave, free childcare, school quality, work-life balance):
- 🇸🇪 SE, 🇫🇮 FI, 🇩🇰 DK, 🇳🇴 NO, 🇮🇸 IS — Nordic model
- 🇩🇪 DE, 🇦🇹 AT, 🇧🇪 BE, 🇳🇱 NL, 🇫🇷 FR — Continental Europe strong
- 🇮🇪 IE, 🇨🇦 CA, 🇦🇺 AU, 🇳🇿 NZ — Anglo-sphere with social-democratic streak
- 🇸🇮 SI, 🇨🇿 CZ — Surprising Eastern strength
- 🇯🇵 JP — top-tier school quality + recent parental-leave expansion (Kishida policy)
- 🇮🇱 IL — strong family infrastructure + highest TFR in OECD
- 🇻🇳 VN — 6-month paid maternity leave (regionally generous)
- 🇸🇬 SG — top-tier MOE schools (#1 PISA 2022) + 16-week maternity + Baby Bonus, but TFR collapse signals housing-cost / work-culture mismatch
- 🇰🇷 KR — generous on paper (1-yr leave + childcare subsidies + Yoon population emergency framework) but TFR 0.72 lowest globally per KOSTAT 2024 — policy/practice gap severe
- 🇱🇮 LI — CHF-bound generous family allowances (small system)

Mid-tier:
- 🇺🇸 US — strong universities + suburban schools, weak federal family policy (no paid leave; childcare ~22% household income, 2023 Treasury)
- 🇦🇪 AE, 🇲🇾 MY, 🇹🇭 TH — strong international/private school options, public quality variable
- 🇺🇾 UY, 🇨🇱 CL — top in LatAm by school metrics; UY notable for Plan Ceibal
- 🇭🇰 HK, 🇹🇼 TW, 🇲🇴 MO — top-tier school quality but high cost / Article-23 NSL sentiment factor (HK) / geopolitical premium (TW); aging fast
- 🇦🇩 AD — Catalan official, tri-system schooling (Andorran/French/Spanish), small economy
- 🇲🇨 MC — French official, private/international schools dominant for HNW expat families
- 🇶🇦 QA, 🇸🇦 SA — Vision 2030 reforming, private international schools dominant for expat family pattern; Arabic + English working in Doha/Riyadh/Jeddah elite
- 🇵🇪 PE, 🇪🇨 EC — public Spanish + Quechua/Aymara (PE) / Kichwa/Shuar (EC); private bilingual in Lima (Miraflores/Barranco/San Isidro) / Quito / Cuenca; 2024 Ecuador security situation affecting family relocation
- 🇵🇾 PY — Spanish + Guaraní co-official, bilingual schooling routine; demographic dividend through ~2040
- 🇦🇲 AM — IT-sector + diaspora schools, Yerevan-concentrated
- 🇦🇿 AZ — ASAN Service efficient governance; private bilingual concentrated Baku

Weakest:
- LatAm informal urban (excluding strong middle-class enclaves)
- Western Balkans (improving)
- 🇪🇬 EG, 🇲🇦 MA, 🇵🇭 PH, 🇮🇩 ID, 🇩🇴 DO — public schools severely under-resourced; quality concentrated in private/international tier
- 🇲🇩 MD — emigration sustained since 1990s, public schools split Russian/Romanian-medium, EU candidate status (Jun 2022 → accession Jun 2024) may reverse trajectory
- 🇹🇳 TN — short maternity (30 days); IMF EFF SUSPENDED Mar 2024 affecting public-sector funding; quality concentrated in Tunis private French/American

## Anti-hallucination

- **Cite Eurostat / OECD / World Bank / UN DESA** as primary; date-stamp data
- **National stats offices** (Census Bureau US, TÜİK TR, FCSC AE, Stat Bureau JP, NSO TH, ONE DO, DANE CO, INE UY/CL/PY, Stats SA, Geostat GE, BPS ID, DOSM MY, GSO VN, PSA PH, CBS IL, HCP MA, CAPMAS EG, Singstat SG, C&SD HK, KOSTAT KR, DGBAS TW, Statistik Liechtenstein LI, DSEC MO, Estadística d'Andorra AD, IMSEE MC, BNS MD, PSA Qatar QA, GASTAT SA, INEI PE, INEC EC, ARMSTAT AM, SSC AZ, INS TN) are primary for in-country data
- **PISA cycle is 3-year**; 2022 results are still authoritative until late 2026 (next cycle 2025 results expected late 2026)
- **PISA participation is voluntary** — DO, ZA, EG, MO, LI, AD, MC do not participate at country level; use TIMSS / UNESCO LLECE / national alternatives, do NOT extrapolate. SG and HK participate as separate jurisdictions
- **Population projections** are uncertain — use UN WPP medium variant
- **TFR varies substantially by year** — use latest single-year data, not multi-year; flag record-lows (KR 2024 0.72 globally lowest, JP 2024, HK 2023, TW 2023, SG 2023, TR 2023, CL 2023, TH 2023)
- **EF EPI** is non-government and methodology-disputed — use as a relative ranking, not absolute
- **Expat-skewed populations** (AE: ~88% expat per 2022 FCSC; MC: ~9.5k Monégasques + ~28.5k others per IMSEE; SG: ~70% citizen + 30% PR/work-pass per Singstat) — citizen and aggregate metrics can diverge sharply; quote both when relevant
- **Israel TFR** is heavily driven by ultra-Orthodox/Haredi sub-population (~6.5 vs secular ~2.0 per 2023 CBS) — aggregate masks composition
- **Moldova population**: BNS official figures exclude Transnistria (~360k claimed by separatist administration but not in BNS series) — always state which scope is used

## Status

Last refreshed: 2026-05-01 (Tier-4 expansion: +8 countries — QA, SA, PE, EC, PY, AM, AZ, TN; cumulative 79 countries: 44 original + 10 Tier-1 + 8 Tier-2 + 9 Tier-3 + 8 Tier-4).
**Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH overall — primary national stats office citations for population/TFR; PISA 2022 cycle for school benchmarks where countries/jurisdictions participate; TIMSS/LLECE/ERCE/national-only alternatives flagged for non-PISA participants. Re-verify TFRs annually given record-low volatility in KR/HK/TW/SG/JP/TR/TH/CL.
