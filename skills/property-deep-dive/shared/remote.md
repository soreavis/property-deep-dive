# Universal `--remote` Section

Foreign-buyer remote-execution mechanisms: can a buyer execute a property purchase **without physically being present**? The answer depends on five distinct mechanisms, each with country-specific scope: (1) POA to a local representative, (2) remote video-conference signing at notary, (3) eIDAS qualified electronic signature (QES) / equivalent, (4) digital land-register filing, (5) mortgage-bank residual wet-ink. Pairs strongly with `shared/language.md` (deed-language + sworn-translator + Hague Apostille chain).

**Snapshot**: 2026-05-09. The remote-execution landscape moved fast 2020-2026 — fully-remote property deeds are now the rule in PT (since DL 126/2021, April 2022) and BE (since 8 April 2024), the global benchmark in EE (since 1 Feb 2020 via e-Notar), but remain unavailable for property in DE, IT, AT, NL, MT, PL, BG, RS, ME, BA, MK, AL, RO, SK, HR, MD where civil-law notarial form requires physical presence even where digital infrastructure exists. eIDAS-2 (Reg (EU) 2024/1183, in force 20 May 2024) introduces the European Digital Identity Wallet (rollout target end of 2026, mandatory acceptance 2027) — but the EUDI Wallet does NOT override national notarial-form requirements. US RON ~46 states + DC + PR; **CA SB 696** signed 30 Sep 2023 with full effective date pushed to **1 Jan 2030** (regulations pending). Federal **SECURE Notarization Act (HR 1777 / S 1561, 119th Congress)** reintroduced May 2025 — NOT enacted as of May 2026.

**Anti-hallucination**: every cluster ends with `Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` and a `Last verified` date. Where a 2024-2026 reform is in parliamentary navette (NL Wet digitale processen Notariaat; US SECURE Notarization Act; CA SB 696 implementation regulations), the doc flags MEDIUM confidence and points to the parliamentary tracker. Forbidden phrasings per `shared/anti-hallucination.md` § Forbidden phrasings are avoided throughout.

**Disambiguation — `--remote` vs `--language` vs `--notary` vs `--scams`**:
- `--remote` = **execution-side**. Can the buyer sign without flying out? POA + RON + e-conveyancing + eIDAS QES + mortgage-bank residual wet-ink.
- `--language` = **language-side**. Deed-language rule + sworn-translator regime + Hague Apostille / POA-translation chain. Companion section.
- `--notary` = **process-side**. Days from offer to deed, closing costs, notary vs solicitor regime, title insurance norms.
- `--scams` = **fraud register**. BEC at closing (relevant — *Hawarden v ENS* SCA 10 Jun 2024 affirms buyer bears BEC risk where bank details could have been verified out-of-band), title forgery, off-plan disappearance.

For most foreign buyers, **POA + apostilled chain to a local representative** is still the universal fallback that works in all 103 countries, regardless of whether the destination has full-remote infrastructure.

## Universal contract

For the property's country, return:

1. **POA mechanism** — local term + statutory anchor + form requirement (private vs notarial vs apostilled-chain) + consulate-bypass availability
2. **Remote video-witnessed deed at notary** — available y/n; scope (property in / excluded); statute; platform; effective date
3. **eIDAS / equivalent QES** — accepted at deed-signing? Format constraints? National-eID or cross-border-recognised?
4. **Digital ID for foreign buyers** — what's accepted; whether non-residents can practically obtain it
5. **Land-register electronic filing** — system name + notary / attorney direct-filing y/n
6. **Mortgage residual wet-ink** — bank-side practice, separate from notary side
7. **2024-2026 reform** — date-stamped, with effective date
8. **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

## Cross-cutting traps to surface every time

These appear across multiple jurisdictions and warrant a flag whenever a foreign buyer is shopping abroad. Detailed mechanism + countries-where-it-bites + mitigation appear in the **Cross-cutting structural detail** section near the end.

1. **eIDAS recognition asymmetry — QES is EU-mutual, deed-validity is national** — Reg (EU) 910/2014 Art. 25(3) mandates cross-border recognition of QES at signature-validity layer, but Art. 2(3) carves out anything imposed by national contract / form law. Each member state's notarial code decides what's accepted at deed-execution. **DE § 16a-d BeurkG** explicitly excludes property *Auflassung*; **AT § 31 GBG** form requires *öffentliche Urkunde*; **CH cantonal mosaic** — most cantons still wet-ink for property; **NL DOBV** scope = BV formation, *transportakte* not remote; **IT** rogito requires *contestualità fisica* per CC + Notarial Law 1913. eIDAS-2 introduces EUDI Wallet but does NOT override these notarial-form rules.

2. **Mortgage-bank residual wet-ink trap — RON-eligible note ≠ RON-eligible loan** — GSE acceptance (Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac since 31 Mar 2020 joint announcement; expanded for manufactured homes 7 Aug 2024 via Fannie SEL 24-04 / Freddie Bulletin 2024-7) does NOT mean every originating lender, state-chartered bank, credit union, or warehouse line accepts RON for the mortgage instrument. Even where notary side is remote-enabled (PT, BE), banks often still require physical signing of the *acte de crédit hypothécaire* / *Schuldbrief* / *Pfandbestellung* / *hipoteca constitutiva*. Get the lender's RON / remote-mortgage policy in writing **before the loan estimate** — verify investor + warehouse line + recording county all accept it.

3. **Time-zone collision on real-time video signing** — RON / Italian *atto da remoto* / French *comparution à distance* / Spanish *videoconferencia* require synchronous audio-video presence so the notary can verify identity, capacity, and absence of duress live. Buyer in opposite TZ (Sydney → Paris, San Francisco → Rome) faces 02:00-06:00 sessions for destination business hours; KBA fail rates rise + bandwidth drops + notary spots fewer duress signs at 3am. **Mitigation**: default to apostilled-POA chain rather than real-time video for buyers > 6 hours offset from destination; POA does the legal work in destination TZ during business hours, buyer signs POA at home in their own business hours.

4. **State / canton / province fragmentation — federation traps** — RON / e-conveyancing statutes are sub-national even where the federal layer is harmonised. **US RON**: ~46 states + DC + PR have permanent statute; **CA SB 696** signed 30 Sep 2023, recognition provisions effective 1 Jan 2024, but California-resident notaries CANNOT perform RON until Sec of State certifies platform OR by **1 Jan 2030 backstop**, whichever earlier (regulations still pending May 2026). **AU PEXA + Sympli interoperability**: ARNECC **suspended** the IOP program in 2024 (no compelling case; settlement-failure risk per IPART). **CA Quebec** = civil-law, separate from common-law ON/BC/AB. **CH** = 26 cantons each with own Notariatsgesetz. Don't extrapolate across jurisdictions — verify per-state / per-canton with the destination county/canton recorder.

5. **Identity-verification infrastructure incompatibility — the Catch-22** — Most national e-ID systems (DigiD, SPID, Cl@ve, MyNumber, Aadhaar, BankID, MitID) require local registration gated by tax ID / residency / local bank account — which the foreign buyer doesn't have *until* they complete the property purchase. eIDAS cross-border node helps EU↔EU but not RoW→EU. KBA (knowledge-based authentication) used in US RON queries US credit bureaus — fails for buyers without US credit history. **Mitigation**: pass-through verification — solicitor / notary in buyer's country of residence performs face-to-face VOI + certifies to destination notary; AU model is cleanest (ARNECC MPR Guidance Note #2 — Australian Embassy / High Commission / Consulate performs overseas VOI). For US RON: choose vendor (NotaryCam, Proof, Notarize) with credential-analysis fallback for non-US passports + biometric liveness; FL § 117.295 expressly permits foreign-passport credential analysis as substitute for KBA.

6. **Apostille / consular legalisation chain still required for foreign POA** — Even when destination notary accepts remote signing, the POA itself originates in the buyer's home jurisdiction and must be authenticated for use abroad. HCCH Apostille Convention (1961) shrinks this to one stamp for member states; non-member states require full consular legalisation (origin notary → home MFA → destination embassy in origin country → sometimes destination MFA), 4-8 weeks. Non-Hague jurisdictions as of May 2026: AE, EG, JO, KW, LB, QA, NG, KE, GH, TW, KH, LK, MV, MY, **TH** (cabinet approval Dec 2025, instrument NOT yet deposited as of May 2026), **VN** (deposited 31 Dec 2025, in force **11 Sept 2026**). Calendar-actionable: re-stamp VN flow on 11 Sept 2026; monitor TH HCCH deposit monthly.

7. **AML/KYC gatekeepers add their own friction** — Solicitors and notaries are AML-obliged entities under EU 5AMLD/6AMLD (and AMLR 2024 in force 10 Jul 2027), UK MLR 2017, US BSA, AU AUSTRAC. Many require **face-to-face** customer-due-diligence regardless of e-signing capability — independent of deed-execution rules. **US-specific layer from 1 Mar 2026**: FinCEN's **Residential Real Estate Reporting Rule** requires settlement / title / escrow / attorneys to file Real Estate Reports for non-financed transfers to legal entities or trusts at any price, nationwide; triggers beneficial-ownership disclosure (≥ 25% interest). **EU layer**: AMLR + AMLA Reg 2024/1620 (Authority HQ Frankfurt) published OJEU 19 Jun 2024, applies 10 Jul 2027. Ask destination solicitor / notary at first contact: "Do you require in-person KYC for foreign buyers, or do you accept (a) home-jurisdiction lawyer-certified VOI, (b) consulate-certified VOI, (c) RON-platform credential-analysis output?" Get the answer in writing.

## Western Europe (FR, IT, ES, PT, DE, AT, NL, BE, LU, GR, CY, MT, CH, IE, UK)

Western Europe splits cleanly into three groups:
- **Fully remote property deeds available**: PT (since DL 126/2021, Apr 2022), BE (since 8 Apr 2024 via Loi 6 juillet 2017 + 2023 Royal Decree).
- **Partial remote (POA + side-deeds + corporate but NOT property sale)**: FR, ES (Ley 11/2023 catalogue), DE (BeurkG § 16a-d corporate only), AT (digitale Beurkundung corporate only), NL (DOBV BV-only), IT (atto pubblico informatico corporate only — rogito requires physical simultaneity), CH (cantonal mosaic, ZH leading from Jan 2025), LU (digitalisation bill in pipeline).
- **Wet-ink + POA universal**: GR (digital filing yes; signing in person or POA), CY (lawyer-led + POA + DLS digital), MT (notarial physical-presence + POA model unchanged), IE (Tailte Éireann eRegistration partial; deed wet-ink), UK (HMLR Mercury-style + Practice Guide 8 / 82).

- **FR** (France): **POA** = *procuration authentique* under Code civil Art. 1369 + 1589 + Loi 25 ventôse XI; notarial form mandatory for sale of real property; private *procuration sous seing privé* insufficient. French consulate procuration bypasses both apostille and sworn-translation. **Remote deed**: Décret n° 2020-1422 (20 Nov 2020, COVID-permanent for procurations) + Arrêté 29 Jan 2024 + **Décret 2024-378 (3 Mars 2024)** extended *comparution à distance* perimeter. Acte de vente immobilière itself **not yet universally remote** — comparution à distance authorised for procurations + certain related acts; full sale deed typically still requires at least one party present with notaire (CSN guidance evolving — verify with [Conseil supérieur du notariat](https://www.notaires.fr/)). Platform: CCN-IDÉLIO. **eIDAS QES**: accepted; ANSSI-certified videoconference platform required at notaire side. **Digital ID**: France Connect + AGENT (resident-only). **Land register**: Télé@ctes ([cadastre.gouv.fr](https://www.cadastre.gouv.fr/)) — notaire files directly since 2008. **Mortgage**: bank typically requires physical sign at notaire. **Trap**: even where "remote" is permitted, deed of sale often still needs one party physically with notaire. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (rapidly evolving; full property deed remote not yet universal).

- **IT** (Italy): **POA** = *procura speciale* under Codice Civile Art. 1392; must match form of principal act — for sale = notarial; apostille if drafted abroad outside EU. Italian consulate procura bypasses apostille and sworn translation. **Remote deed**: D.Lgs. 110/2010 + DM 8 Feb 2023 enabled *atto pubblico informatico* (digital-format deed) via **iStrumentum** platform (CNN — Consiglio Nazionale del Notariato). **Rogito a distanza for property purchase NOT available** — Italian notarial law (L. 89/1913) still requires *contestualità fisica* of notaio + parties at signing ([blog.notaiotorino.org](https://blog.notaiotorino.org/rogito-online-in-italia/), [notariato.it](https://www.notariato.it/en/notariato/the-computerised-public-deed/)). The "digital deed" replaces paper artifact, not in-person ceremony. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on documents; not substitute for notary presence at property sale. **Digital ID**: SPID + CIE (foreigners with EU residence can obtain SPID via Aruba / Poste). **Land register**: Adempimento Unico telematico via Punto Fisco / Agenzia delle Entrate — notaio files trascrizione + voltura catastale + imposta directly. **Mortgage**: most banks require physical presence; *procura speciale* accepted. **Trap**: "atto pubblico informatico" in marketing copy ≠ remote — verify whether notaio asks for in-person attendance. **Confidence**: HIGH (statute + practitioner guidance unanimous on physical presence).

- **ES** (Spain): **POA** = *poder notarial* under Reglamento Notarial Art. 167 + Ley del Notariado 1862; apostille if from outside EU. Spanish consulate poder bypasses chain. **Remote deed**: **Ley 11/2023 of 8 May 2023** (transposing Directive (EU) 2019/1151 + eIDAS-2 essentials) — notarial provisions in force **9 November 2023**, registry provisions in force 9 May 2024. Permits *autorización por videoconferencia* for **a defined catalogue** including company formation, certain mortgage acts, simple POAs — but **purchase escritura (compraventa) NOT in the remote-by-videoconference catalogue** ([notariosyregistradores.com summary](https://www.notariosyregistradores.com/web/normas/destacadas/resumen-de-la-ley-11-2023-de-8-de-mayo-digitalizacion-de-actuaciones-notariales-y-registrales-y-otros-contenidos/)). Platform: [sede.notariado.org](https://www.sede.notariado.org/). **eIDAS QES**: accepted for catalogued acts. **Digital ID**: Cl@ve + DNI electrónico + Cl@ve PIN — foreign-resident NIE-holders can obtain Cl@ve. **Land register**: FloTI / SIGNO — notario files directly to Registro de la Propiedad ([registradores.org](https://www.registradores.org/)). **Mortgage**: BBVA / Santander accept *poder notarial* + apostille; some allow online video-formation under Ley 11/2023 catalogue. **Trap**: media often conflates "actos notariales online" with "compraventa online" — catalogue excludes property sale deed itself. **Confidence**: HIGH (Ley 11/2023 catalogue clear; property sale not in catalogue).

- **PT** (Portugal): 🟢 **FULL REMOTE PROPERTY DEED AVAILABLE** since April 2022. **POA** = *procuração com poderes especiais* under Código Civil art. 262; *forma* must match — for property = notarial or *autenticada*; apostille if from outside EU. Portuguese consulate bypasses. **Remote deed**: **Decreto-Lei n.º 126/2021** enabled *atos autênticos por videoconferência* effective April 2022 ([gov.pt — Casa Pronta](https://www2.gov.pt/servicos/usar-o-servico-casa-pronta), [idealista.pt](https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2022/04/04/51684-escritura-da-casa-ja-pode-ser-feita-a-distancia-a-partir-de-hoje)) — **including escritura de compra e venda de imóvel**. PT among the most permissive in EU for property deed remote-signing. Casa Pronta one-stop is the digital portal. Recent additions: **DL 10/2024** ("Simplex Urbanístico") removed mandatory Ficha Técnica + utilization licence at signing. **eIDAS QES**: accepted; Chave Móvel Digital is eIDAS-notified. **Digital ID**: Cartão de Cidadão + Chave Móvel Digital — non-resident foreigners can obtain CMD via Portuguese consulate. **Land register**: SIRP (Sistema Integrado do Registo Predial) via Casa Pronta — notário/Casa Pronta files directly. **Mortgage**: most PT banks accept *procuração*; full remote sometimes possible with eIDAS-notified ID. **Trap**: Casa Pronta videoconferência requires notário/conservador acceptance — not all are equipped; smaller comarcas may decline. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **DE** (Germany): **POA** = *Vollmacht* under § 167 BGB; for property purchase the POA must itself be **notarised** under § 311b BGB (no private POA). Apostille required if drafted abroad outside dispense-list (most non-EU states). German consulate beglaubigte Vollmacht bypasses. **Remote deed**: **§§ 16a-16e BeurkG** since 1 Aug 2022 ([bnotk.de](https://www.bnotk.de/), [video.bnotk.de](https://video.bnotk.de/)) — but scope **explicitly limited** to GmbH cash-formation, UG formation, certain corporate acts, *Auflassungsvormerkung* preparatory acts. **The property purchase deed (Auflassung) itself remains wet-ink before the notary** — not in § 16a scope as of May 2026. Federal portal lists exhaustively. Draft *elektronische Präsenzbeurkundung* legislation tabled 16 Jul 2025 — even that keeps physical presence. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on standalone documents; does not substitute for notarial form under § 128 BGB. **Digital ID**: Personalausweis-eID + AusweisApp + Bund-ID; foreign buyers cannot use without German *Aufenthaltstitel* with eID-chip. **Land register**: e-Grundbuch via ELSTER + state-level Grundbuchamt; notary files Eintragungsantrag via ERV (Elektronischer Rechtsverkehr) — most Bundesländer fully digital, NRW + Bayern leading. **Mortgage**: Sparkasse / Commerzbank typically require physical sign of *Grundschuldbestellung*; *Vollmacht* accepted for non-residents via Beurkundung at German consulate or apostilled foreign notary. **Trap**: confusing § 16a "online notarisation" with full remote property purchase — the latter is **NOT possible**. **Confidence**: HIGH (statute clear; property explicitly excluded).

- **AT** (Austria): **POA** = *Vollmacht* under § 1004 ABGB; for property the POA must be **notariell beglaubigt** (notarial signature certification) under § 26 GBG; apostille if drafted abroad outside dispense states. Austrian consulate beglaubigte Vollmacht bypasses. **Remote deed**: *Digitale Beurkundung* permanently enabled since § 79b NO + Notariatsordnungs-Novelle 2020 (BGBl. I Nr. 71/2020), with NEIV (Notar-E-Identifikations-Verordnung) governing WebID procedure ([nhp.at](https://www.nhp.at/en/leistungen/digital-services/), [CMS expert guide](https://cms.law/en/int/expert-guides/cms-expert-guide-to-e-signatures-in-real-estate-documents/austria)). **However: real property sale deeds for Grundbuch incorporation cannot be replaced by electronic signatures** — § 31 GBG requires *öffentliche Urkunde* or gerichtlich/notariell beglaubigte private document; form requirement is statutorily preserved. Notary may produce digital deed + certified paper copy for Grundbuch filing. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on documents; does not replace notarial form for property. **Digital ID**: ID Austria (replaced Bürgerkarte / Handy-Signatur 5 Dec 2023). **Land register**: WebERV mandatory for notaries since 2007 — notar files Grundbuchgesuch directly to BG (Bezirksgericht). **Mortgage**: Pfandbestellung typically physical at notary; *Vollmacht* accepted. **Trap**: "digitale Beurkundung" exists but Grundbuch-eintragungsfähigkeit narrow — verify with notary that specific deed format will be accepted by BG. **Confidence**: HIGH (BGBl. + GBG + NEIV statutory; property-deed remote narrow).

- **NL** (Netherlands): **POA** = *volmacht* under BW 3:60 + Wet op het notarisambt § 39; for *transportakte* (transfer of property) the volmacht must be in **notarial form** — private volmacht insufficient. Apostille required from outside EU. Netherlands consulate volmacht bypasses. **Remote deed**: limited — **DOBV (Digitaal Oprichten BV) since 1 Jan 2024** enables full-remote BV (limited company) formation via videoconference + DigiD + eIDAS ([notaris.nl](https://www.notaris.nl/nieuws/vanaf-1-januari-op-afstand-een-bv-oprichten)). **Property transportakte: NOT available remotely** — must be signed at notaris's office or via apostilled volmacht to a Dutch representative. *Wet digitale processen Notariaat* draft (proposed 2025) would expand scope but not yet enacted. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on standalone documents; not substitute for notarial form on property. **Digital ID**: DigiD + eHerkenning (business); eIDAS recognition since 2018 — non-residents need BSN to obtain DigiD. **Land register**: Kadaster + WPNR pipeline; notaris files directly via KIK (Kadaster Info Keten). **Mortgage**: bank typically requires physical sign or volmacht-via-notaris-medewerker; eHerkenning for legal-entity buyers accepted. **Trap**: "online notaris" marketing on Dutch sites usually means online consultation + paper signing, not full remote deed for property. **Confidence**: HIGH (DOBV scope statutorily limited to BV formation).

- **BE** (Belgium): 🟢 **FULL REMOTE PROPERTY DEED AVAILABLE** since 8 April 2024. **POA** = *procuration / volmacht* under Code civil art. 1984; for property must be in **acte authentique notarial** form. Apostille required from outside EU. Belgian consulate procuration bypasses. **Remote deed**: **8 April 2024** breakthrough — most progressive EU regime after PT; Loi 6 juillet 2017 (digital notarial acts framework) + 2020 COVID extension + 2023 Royal Decree → from 8 April 2024 most notarial acts including **property purchase, mortgage, donation can be signed digitally either at the notary's office or fully remotely via videoconference + digital POA** ([notaire.be](https://www.notaire.be/actualites/signer-son-acte-notarie-numeriquement-possible-partir-du-8-avril)). Storage in MICEN (Minutiers Centraux Électroniques Notariaux). Citizen wallet: Izimi ([izimi.be](https://www.izimi.be/)). **Wills + testamentary acts excluded** — must remain wet-ink. **eIDAS QES**: accepted; itsme + eID native flows. **Digital ID**: itsme + eID (Belgian residents); eIDAS-notified — non-residents need to use foreign eIDAS scheme via notary's wallet acceptance. **Land register**: e-Notariat via BIPT integration; notaire files directly. **Mortgage**: *acte de crédit hypothécaire* now eligible for digital remote signing under same regime. **Trap**: foreign buyers without itsme rely on the *procuration digitale* — give POA to notary's clerk who signs in office while you watch via videoconference. Not all notaries are equipped; verify before contracting. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **LU** (Luxembourg): **POA** = *procuration* under Code civil art. 1984; for property must be in *forme authentique* (notarial). Apostille required from outside EU. Luxembourgish consulate procuration bypasses. **Remote deed**: status **transitional** — *projet de loi sur la digitalisation du notariat* permitting remote acts (except wills) for sale + compromis remains in legislative pipeline as of May 2026 (verify via [chd.lu](https://www.chd.lu/) parliamentary tracker). *Loi du 14 août 2000 sur le commerce électronique* + 2007 amendments + Loi 13 juillet 2007 sur l'archivage électronique govern document side, not deed-remote-ceremony. Practitioners report POA-to-Luxembourg-notaire as the dominant remote-execution path. **eIDAS QES**: accepted; LuxTrust notified. **Digital ID**: LuxTrust + GouvID — non-residents can obtain LuxTrust token via Luxembourg consulate or designated agent. **Land register**: AED (Administration de l'Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA) cadastre digital; notaire files directly. **Mortgage**: *acte hypothécaire* typically physical or via notarial procuration. **Confidence**: LOW-MEDIUM (digitalisation-of-notariat bill status unclear in primary sources as of May 2026).

- **GR** (Greece): **POA** = *πληρεξούσιο* under Αστικός Κώδικας art. 217 — for sale of immovable property (Art. 369 AK) must be in **συμβολαιογραφικό έγγραφο** (notarial form). Apostille required from outside EU. Greek consulate πληρεξούσιο (drafted by consul-as-notary) bypasses both apostille and sworn-translation chains. **Remote deed**: Law 4961/2022 + Law 4912/2022 / Law 4727/2020 enabled *ηλεκτρονική σύμβαση* (electronic contract) framework. Since **1 Jan 2024**, Greek property purchases must use the **Ψηφιακός Φάκελος Ακινήτου / Digital Property Folder** — notary submits all documents digitally, Cadastre registration in ~1 day ([apgp.eu](https://www.apgp.eu/en/real-estate-purchases-in-greece/)). **However: signing of συμβόλαιο πώλησης (sale contract) still requires physical presence of parties or POA-holder before συμβολαιογράφος** — full-remote videoconference deed for property not in scope. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on documents (gov.gr Wallet eIDAS-notified Apr 2024). **Digital ID**: Taxisnet + Gov.gr Wallet — non-residents need ΑΦΜ (tax number) to enrol; foreign-buyer pattern uses POA. **Land register**: Hellenic Cadastre / Ελληνικό Κτηματολόγιο — fully digital nationwide as of 2025; notary files digitally via Ψηφιακός Φάκελος. **Mortgage**: physical at notary or via apostilled πληρεξούσιο. **Trap**: "digital property folder" is process-digitisation, not remote-signing. **Confidence**: HIGH for digital filing; MEDIUM for remote-signing practice (POA dominant).

- **CY** (Cyprus): **POA** = *power of attorney* under Powers of Attorney Law Cap. 23 + Sale of Land (Specific Performance) Law Cap. 232 / Law 81(I)/2011; **no civil-law notary** — common-law/lawyer-led conveyancing. POA can be (a) signed at Cyprus High Commission/Embassy abroad (€8.54 fee), or (b) signed before foreign notary public + apostille + Greek sworn translation. **Remote deed**: there is no notarial deed in Cyprus — the "deed" is the **Sale Agreement registered at Department of Lands and Surveys (DLS)** within 60 days under Specific Performance Law. DLS portal e-conveyancing online-registration since 2017. **Buyer never needs to be in Cyprus**: standard pattern is foreign buyer signs POA → Cyprus lawyer files Sale Agreement at DLS → completes title transfer when title deeds issue. **eIDAS QES**: accepted. **Digital ID**: ARIADNI ([cypruspassport.gov.cy](https://cypruspassport.gov.cy/)) — non-residents can register with passport. **Land register**: DLS Land Registry — lawyer files; foreign buyer never physically present unless they wish. **Mortgage**: typical Cyprus mortgage through Bank of Cyprus / Hellenic Bank requires ID verification but accepts POA + apostille. **Trap**: title-deed delays — many properties (esp pre-2015 developer-built) still lack separate Title Deed at sale; SPA registration buys protection but title transfer can lag years. Cyprus POA template specific — DLS rejects generic foreign POA without Specific Performance-compliant clauses; use Cyprus-lawyer-drafted template. **Confidence**: HIGH (lawyer + POA model is universal and statutorily entrenched).

- **MT** (Malta): **POA** = *prokura* under Civil Code art. 1856-1888; for immovable property must be **notarial** (drafted/authenticated by Maltese notary or Maltese consulate, OR foreign notary + apostille + EN/MT translation if not in EN). Power of Attorney must be registered with Director of Public Registry. **Remote deed**: **NOT available** — *kuntratt finali* (final deed of sale) before notary requires **physical simultaneity of all parties + notary** ([notariesofmalta.org](https://www.notariesofmalta.org/buyingandselling.php)). If a party cannot attend, *prokura* is the only path. Two witnesses + identity-verification (ID card / passport / two attestors) required at deed execution. **eIDAS QES**: accepted on documents; not substitute for notarial form. **Digital ID**: e-ID Malta + my.gov.mt — non-residents need MT ID card. **Land register**: Land Registry Malta + Public Registry; notary files post-deed. **Mortgage**: bank typically requires physical or POA + apostille; AIP permit requirement adds layer for non-EU foreigners (LN 174/2024 minimum values €174,274 flat / €300,619 other). **Trap**: AIP permit must be in place before deed — foreign-buyer POA-holder also needs to manage AIP application timing. Prokura must be registered with Director of Public Registry — lawyers sometimes overlook the registration step, voiding the chain. **Confidence**: HIGH (notarial physical-presence + POA model is universal).

- **CH** (Switzerland): **POA** = *Vollmacht / procuration / procura* under OR Art. 32-40; for property the POA form follows **cantonal** notarial law — typically requires notarial certification of signature + cantonal-language. Apostille required from outside EU/EEA. Swiss consulate POA bypasses. **Remote deed**: **CANTONAL** — most of the 26 cantons still require physical presence of parties + cantonal notary at deed signing. **Zurich**: from 1 Jan 2025 cantonal authorities' digital communication enabled including some signing flows. **St. Gallen, Geneva** offer some digital signature certification of authenticity for documents — not full property-deed remote-signing. **ZertES** (revised 2016, in force 1 Jan 2017) governs e-signature; QES recognised. 29 Jan 2025 Federal Council instructed DETEC + FDFA to negotiate EU mutual-recognition of e-signatures — not yet in effect. **eIDAS QES**: NOT eIDAS-area — Swiss QES under ZertES is the recognised standard; eIDAS QES accepted in some cantons but not uniformly. **Digital ID**: SwissID + new state e-ID *e-ID Schweiz* (referendum approved 7 Mar 2024, statutory rollout planned 2026); SuisseID retired Mar 2024. **Land register**: cantonal *e-Grundbuch / Terravis* — most cantons digitised; notary files directly. **Mortgage**: *Schuldbrief / cédule hypothécaire* typically physical at notary; some cantons accept POA. **Trap**: cantonal variation extreme — Geneva / Vaud / Ticino practice differs from Zurich / St. Gallen; verify with the canton-specific *Notariatskammer*. ZertES QES ≠ eIDAS QES — foreign QES may not be accepted; buyer needs SwissID or notary-supplied e-signing. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (cantonal mosaic; ZH most permissive but not yet for full property deed in all configurations).

- **IE** (Ireland): **POA** = under Powers of Attorney Act 1996 (general + enduring); Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 commenced 26 Apr 2023 — replaces EPA with new EPOA framework. **Remote deed**: deed execution remains wet-ink in practice. **Tailte Éireann** (operational Mar 2023) merged Property Registration Authority + Ordnance Survey Ireland + Valuation Office. **eRegistration** — solicitor-only Tailte Éireann portal at landdirect.ie; covers selected registration applications. NOT full e-conveyancing. **Foreign-buyer pattern**: Irish solicitor + apostilled POA + wet-ink deed of transfer + paper Land Registry filing. **e-conveyancing target**: Conveyancing & Probate Reform Group target end-of-2027 for full e-conveyancing. 2024 friction: Law Society Gazette (Oct 2024) reported Tailte Éireann rejection rates / vague reasons; engagement now improving. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (modernization in flux).

- **UK** (England & Wales): **POA** = Powers of Attorney Act 1971 + Mental Capacity Act 2005 (LPA replaced EPA); Trustee Delegation Act 1999 for property trustees. **Deed execution**: Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s1 — must be signed in presence of witness who is **physically present**. Law Commission *Electronic Execution of Documents* (Sept 2019) confirmed e-signature satisfies "signed" but witness physical-presence requirement remains. **Mercury-style execution**: Law Society guidance (Apr 2020, COVID) — sign-print-scan PDFs of deed signature pages permitted between solicitors; retained post-COVID for non-HMLR deeds. **HMLR e-signed deeds**: Practice Guide 8 + Practice Guide 82. "Witnessed electronic signatures" accepted from 27 Jul 2020 (signer + witness both sign electronically, witness still physically present). QES accepted later. PG8 last updated 29 Sept 2025. **HMLR Digital Identity Standard ("Safe Harbour")**: Practice Guide 81 — Requirements 1-4 (corrected: HMLR uses ID1 / ID2 + Digital ID Standard, NOT "DIV1/DIV2/DIV3" terminology). Conveyancer following standard discharges identity-verification duty against HMLR recourse claims. **Foreign-buyer remote pattern**: solicitor + POA (signed before UK consular officer / notary public + apostille) + Mercury or QES-signed transfer deed. Standard. **Mortgage**: lender-by-lender. HSBC/Halifax/Barclays generally accept solicitor-witnessed POA for foreign-domiciled borrowers; Nationwide more conservative (verify per-application). **Trap**: HMLR will not accept Mercury-style for the **transfer deed itself unless the witness was physically present** — solicitor's office abroad or UK consular post commonly used. **Authority**: [gov.uk PG8](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/execution-of-deeds/practice-guide-8-execution-of-deeds), [PG82](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electronic-signatures-accepted-by-hm-land-registry-pg82), [PG81](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/encouraging-the-use-of-digital-technology-in-identity-verification-pg81). **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **Scotland** (separate regime): Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 + Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012 + Land Register (Automated Registration) Regulations 2014 (SSI 2014/347). **ARTL** (Automated Registration of Title to Land) — Registers of Scotland's e-conveyancing platform live since 2007; PKI smart-card based; limited uptake (only whole-title dealings, with carve-outs). **QES required** for probative electronic deeds. As of 2024, only one UK-trusted-list QTSP, and it does not yet support remote QES on common e-signing platforms — practical constraint on full-remote. **Foreign-buyer pattern**: Scottish solicitor + apostilled POA + wet-ink missives still common. **Trap**: Scotland is NOT under HMLR — do not conflate UK guidance. **Confidence**: HIGH.

## Nordics + Iceland (SE, FI, NO, DK, IS)

The Nordics + IS run a fundamentally different model — **no civil-law notary** (or use *kaupanvahvistaja* / Sýslumaður / *fastighetsmäklare*-led variants). All five have **fully digital land registries**. The bottleneck for foreign buyers is **eID enrolment** (BankID / Suomi.fi / BankID NO / MitID / Audkenni), not deed-signing. Non-residents almost always proceed via **POA to a local lawyer** who completes the digital filing.

- **SE** (Sweden): **POA** = *fullmakt* under Avtalslagen (1915:218) ch. 2; for property purchase **no statutory notarial-form requirement** (no civil-law notary in Sweden). Fullmakt in writing + 2 witnesses sufficient under Lantmäteriet acceptance practice; if foreign-issued, sworn translation expected. **Remote deed**: no notarial deed in Swedish system — *köpekontrakt* (purchase contract) and *köpebrev* (deed of confirmation) are private contracts between buyer + seller, often facilitated by *fastighetsmäklare* (FMI-supervised broker) and / or *advokat*. Foreign buyer can execute fully via fullmakt to Swedish lawyer; **physical presence not legally required** at any stage. *Lagfart* (registration of title) at Lantmäteriet via post or digital. **Digital ID**: BankID (universal — Swedish-bank-issued; NOT eIDAS-notified to EU peers — interoperability trap); FrejaeID+ as alternative; non-residents typically cannot obtain BankID without personnummer. **Land register**: [Lantmäteriet fastighetsregister](https://www.lantmateriet.se/) — fully digital lagfart filing; processing 1-3 weeks typical. **Mortgage**: Nordic banks generally accept *fullmakt*; some require BankID for digital signing. **Trap**: 2-witness fullmakt requirement on property POA sometimes overlooked when foreign POAs arrive single-witness. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **FI** (Finland): **POA** = *valtakirja* under Oikeustoimilaki (Contracts Act) ch. 2 §10; for property must be in writing + signed; if from abroad, sworn translation + apostille. **Remote deed**: real-property purchase requires *kaupanvahvistaja* (public purchase witness — state-appointed property-conveyance officer, not a civil-law notary) under **Maakaari (Land Code) 540/1995 ch. 2 § 1**. KV traditionally witnesses *kauppakirja* in person. **However, since 2013 fully digital property-purchase via Maanmittauslaitos (NLS) Online Service / Kiinteistövaihdannan palvelu has been available** — buyer + seller authenticate with Suomi.fi-tunnistautuminen + sign electronically; KV not required if e-purchase is used. Most active foreign-buyer path: POA to Finnish lawyer / mäklare for in-person KV signing. **Digital ID**: Suomi.fi-tunnistautuminen + bank-issued mobile certs + Mobiilivarmenne; non-residents need Finnish HETU (personal ID code). **Land register**: Maanmittauslaitos / NLS Lainhuutorekisteri — fully digital. **Mortgage**: bank-side typically accepts e-signing for resident customers; non-resident pattern is POA + lawyer. **Trap**: KV-witnessed paper kauppakirja vs. digital-purchase via NLS are two distinct paths — verify which the seller's broker is using; foreign POA must specify e-purchase authority explicitly if buyer wants the lawyer to use NLS digital path on their behalf. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **NO** (Norway): **POA** = *fullmakt* — no notarial-form requirement; written + signed sufficient. Hague Apostille party since 1983. **Remote deed**: **fully digital via Statens Kartverket + BankID since 2007** ([kartverket.no/en/property](https://www.kartverket.no/en/property/skjema/deed)). *Skjøte* (deed) submitted electronically; *tinglysning* (registration) processed in 1 business day for digital filings. **Foreign buyer without BankID**: standard pattern is POA to Norwegian lawyer or *eiendomsmegler* who completes digital tinglysning on buyer's behalf. Norwegian foreign-service official at embassy/consulate can certify foreign signature with NO embassy stamp. **Digital ID**: BankID + MinID + Buypass + Commfides — eIDAS-notified (NO via EEA); non-residents need fødselsnummer or D-nummer to enrol. **Land register**: Statens Kartverket DLR / Grunnboken — fully digital since 2007. **Mortgage**: Norwegian banks operate fully digital lending with BankID; foreign-buyer fallback POA to lawyer. **Trap**: foreign buyers attempt to use foreign apostille only — Kartverket also accepts NO embassy/consulate signature confirmation as alternative; pick faster path. D-nummer onboarding can take 4-8 weeks — start before signing. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **DK** (Denmark): **POA** = *fuldmagt* — written + signed; for *tinglysning* (registration) the fuldmagt must allow lawyer to sign with MitID on the principal's behalf. Apostille required from outside EU/EEA. **Remote deed**: **Tinglysning fully digital since 2009** via [tinglysning.dk](https://www.tinglysning.dk/). **Foreign buyer practical reality**: tinglysning REQUIRES MitID to sign — non-resident foreigners typically cannot obtain MitID without CPR; most foreign buyers grant POA to Danish *advokat* who signs digitally with their MitID. *Skøde* (deed) digital. **Digital ID**: MitID (replaced NemID 30 Oct 2023) + MitID Erhverv (business). **Land register**: tinglysning.dk — Domstolsstyrelsen-operated, fully digital. **Mortgage**: Danish *realkreditlån* (mortgage bonds) digital via MitID; foreign-buyer pattern is POA to advokat. **Trap**: foreign buyers without CPR cannot sign at tinglysning.dk themselves — POA is the operative path, not in-person at notary. MitID Erhverv onboarding for foreign-incorporated buyer-vehicles still maturing 2025-2026. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **IS** (Iceland): **POA** = *umboð* — written + signed; for property typically witnessed and accompanied by passport copy. Apostille required from outside EU/EEA (IS Hague party since 2004). **Remote deed**: **Rafræn þinglýsing (electronic registration) at Sýslumaður (District Commissioner) fully digital since 2020** via ísland.is for residents with Audkenni. *Kaupsamningur* (purchase agreement) and *afsal* (deed of transfer) submitted to Sýslumaður — digital path available with Audkenni. **Foreign buyer**: typically POA to Icelandic lawyer who signs digitally with Audkenni; foreign signature verifiable via Icelandic embassy or via apostille. **EEA/EFTA citizens with kennitala + domicile**: may purchase freely; non-EEA citizens require ministerial permission under Lög nr. 19/1966. **Digital ID**: Audkenni Ísland + Ísland.is — non-residents can in some cases obtain temporary kennitala but Audkenni typically requires Icelandic banking relationship. **Land register**: Þjóðskrá Íslands fasteignaskrá (now under HMS) — fully digital. **Mortgage**: Icelandic banks digital with Audkenni; foreign-buyer fallback POA to lawyer. **Trap**: non-EEA foreign buyer ministerial permission must be in place before deed; remote-signing infrastructure doesn't bypass this gate. **Confidence**: HIGH.

## CEE / Baltics / Balkans (CZ, SK, PL, HU, SI, HR, RS, ME, BA, MK, AL, MD, RO, BG, EE, LV, LT)

Three subgroups:
- **Genuinely operational remote-property-deed**: 🟢 EE (since 1 Feb 2020 — global benchmark), LT (since 1 Jul 2021), LV (since 1 Jul 2018, but resident-only in practice).
- **Legally yes, practically rare**: CZ (statute since Sep 2021 + Jul 2022; foreign buyers still default to apostilled POA), HU (lawyer-countersigned electronic private deed dominant; not video-notary).
- **Not available for property**: PL (most restrictive — actively rejecting foreign remote POAs per *iNPN 1(98)/2025*), BG, SK, RO, HR, SI (statute since Oct 2022, target Jun 2025 slipped — verify go-live), RS, ME, BA, MK, AL, MD.

- **EE** (Estonia): 🟢 **GLOBAL BENCHMARK**. **POA** = *volikiri*; TsÜS § 117–128 + VÕS. For property the POA itself must be **notarised** (TsÜS § 80 + AÕS § 119¹) — pure consular notarisation + apostille acceptable. **Remote notarial signing**: **fully operational since 1 Feb 2020** under Notariaadiseadus § 30 + § 31; e-Notar portal e-notar.ee handles **real-estate sale, mortgage, share transfer, marriage contracts** remotely. Identification: Estonian e-ID / Mobile-ID / Smart-ID / **e-Residency card** + Veriff biometric facial-recognition cross-check against passport. **e-Residency caveat**: 180,000+ e-Residents (2024); e-Residency is a **digital identity for transactions**, NOT residence permit, NOT tax-residency mechanism, does not confer right to enter Estonia. **eIDAS QES**: e-ID card, Mobile-ID, Smart-ID, e-Residency digital ID — all qualified. **Land register**: kinnistusraamat.rik.ee — fully digital since 2010, notary submits directly post-signing. **Practitioner trap**: notaries are **not legally obliged** to provide remote service — confirm BEFORE booking; some refuse non-resident clients citing AML. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **LT** (Lithuania): 🟢 **POA** = *įgaliojimas*; CK 2.137–2.144. Property POA must be in notarial form. **Remote notarial signing**: operational since **1 Jul 2021** — Notariato įstatymo 28¹ str. (Law on the Notarial Profession, art. 28¹). Real-estate purchase, mortgage, securities transfer, marriage contracts remotely permitted via **eNotaras** portal. Excluded: testaments, fact-of-being-alive certificates. Identification via Elektroniniai valdžios vartai (e-government gateway) + qualified e-signature (eID card / m-Parašas / Smart-ID). **2025 volume**: ~70,000 remote acts in H1 2025 (+22% YoY); ~50/month per notary. **Land register**: registrucentras.lt — fully digital, notary files automatically. **Practitioner note**: hybrid mode (one party in office, one remote) explicitly supported. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **LV** (Latvia): 🟢 (with foreign-buyer caveat). **POA** = *pilnvara*; CL § 2289–2317. Property POA notarised. **Remote notarial signing**: operational since **1 Jul 2018** — first in EU/Baltic to legalise. Portal: **latvijasnotars.lv** (DigiNotārs). Covers POA, real-estate sale, mortgage, divorce, inheritance opening, wills. Identity via eParaksts (mobile or smart-card) on portal video-bridge OR Smart-ID via dokobit.com. **Practitioner trap (CRITICAL)**: per Sorainen 2020 + subsequent practice, **remote service is currently limited to residents of Latvia** holding eParaksts/Smart-ID linked to Latvian PIN. Foreign buyers without LV residency cannot use latvijasnotars.lv directly — must operate via apostilled POA executed at LV consulate or before foreign notary, then attorney signs the deed in Riga. Verify with each notary as practice may have evolved post-eIDAS-2. **eIDAS QES**: eParaksts (qualified, LVRTC-issued) + eParaksts mobile. **Land register**: zemesgramata.lv — digital, notary submits. **Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH (statute+portal HIGH; foreign-buyer access scope MEDIUM).

- **CZ** (Czech Republic): **POA** = *plná moc*; OZ (89/2012 Sb.) § 441–456. For property transfer POA must have officially-certified signature (`úředně ověřený podpis`) — usually notary or Czech Point. Apostille required if executed abroad. **Remote/electronic notarial deed**: enabled by amendment to **Notarial Code 358/1992 Sb. in force from September 2021** + Act on Trust Services for Electronic Transactions amendment, 1 Jul 2022. Notary may draft notarial deed in electronic form and identify signatory remotely. **BUT real-estate carve-out**: Civil Code § 560 + Cadastral Act 256/2013 Sb. § 7 + Regulation 357/2013 Sb. § 62(1) require sale agreement signatures to use RES (recognized e-signature) + qualified time stamp, OR wet-ink with officially-certified signatures. In practice, for foreign buyers without a Czech eID, **the wet-ink + apostilled POA path remains dominant**. Pure remote video-conf real-estate sale is technically feasible since 2021/2022 but uncommon for foreign buyers; mortgage co-signing is residual wet-ink almost always. **eIDAS QES**: NIA + Bankovní identita + BankID — fully qualified. Foreign buyers without Bankovní identita cannot use shortcut. **Land register**: ČÚZK / Katastr nemovitostí — fully digital, notary or attorney files via dataschránka. **Trap**: don't conflate Building Act (283/2021 Sb. effective 1 Jul 2024 — building permits) with notarial reform. **Confidence**: HIGH on legal framework; MEDIUM on foreign-buyer real-world remote execution.

- **SK** (Slovakia): **POA** = *plnomocenstvo*; OZ 40/1964 Zb.; for property: signature must be officially certified (osvedčený podpis); apostille if executed abroad. **Remote notarial signing**: Notársky poriadok 323/1992 Zb. supports electronic notarial deeds since 2018, primarily for **company-law acts**. **Property deeds NOT covered by remote-form statute** — must be in notary's office in Slovakia (or executed via apostilled POA + Slovak attorney appears). **eIDAS QES**: eID karta + Slovensko.sk — qualified. **Land register**: Kataster nehnuteľností (Úrad geodézie, kartografie a katastra SR) — digital filing supported, but signed deed still notarised in person. **Practitioner pattern**: foreign buyers near-universally use apostilled POA executed at SK consulate or local foreign notary. **Confidence**: HIGH on the wet-ink-for-property reality.

- **PL** (Poland): 🔴 **MOST RESTRICTIVE IN EU**. **POA** = *pełnomocnictwo*; KC art. 95–109. For property purchase/sale POA MUST itself be in the form of a notarial deed (*forma aktu notarialnego*) — KC art. 158 + 99 § 1. Notary must be Polish, OR consular Polish notary, OR foreign Latin-system notary in **AUTHENTIC FORM** (akt notarialny) with apostille. **Remote notarial signing for property: NOT available**. Polish KC requires physical notarial form for the conveyancing deed (umowa przenosząca własność). No legal pathway to remote video-conf property signing as of 2026. **CRITICAL practitioner trap (2025)**: Polish notaries have begun **rejecting foreign remote-issued POAs** (e.g., POAs signed via video-conference before a foreign notary in EE/LT). Per *Notariusze.waw.pl* iNPN 1(98)/2025 (Paweł Czubik, "Niedopuszczalność przeniesienia własności nieruchomości w Polsce na podstawie pełnomocnictwa udzielonego zagranicą zdalnie") — **the form of the POA is governed by lex causae (Polish law) and remote-issued foreign POAs do not satisfy KC art. 158 forma aktu notarialnego**. Foreign buyers must execute POA either: (a) at Polish consulate, (b) before a foreign notary **in person, in authentic-form, then apostille**. Remote video-conf foreign POA → POA invalid → entire transfer void. **eIDAS QES**: ePUAP + mojeID + mObywatel — qualified domestically; do NOT substitute for notarial form for property. **Land register**: Księgi wieczyste (ekw.ms.gov.pl) — digital portal since 2010 for read; e-filing of applications post-deed digital but only by notary. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **HU** (Hungary): **POA** = *meghatalmazás*; Ptk. 6:11–6:17. For property: **lawyer-countersigned private deed (*ügyvéd ellenjegyzéssel*)** OR notarial deed; if executed abroad, apostille + sworn HU translation. **Remote notarial signing**: *távolléti közokirat* under Tv. 2008/CXV § 75/A — operational on **MOKK** platform. Real-estate sale: still mostly handled by **lawyer-countersigned electronic private deed** (NOT notarial) per the new e-property regime; lawyers can use qualified e-signatures + remote ID. **NREA / e-RER reform — DATE CORRECTION**: New Real Estate Register Act (C of 2021 / NREA / E-RER) **entered into force 1 October 2024** (NOT Feb 2024 as repeatedly cited in older sources). Practical electronic land-registry **went live 16 January 2025**. **2025 reality**: lawyer drafts SPA as electronic document with QES → submits to land registry electronically → 30-day registration. Foreign buyer can sign with own QES from anywhere if accepted by lawyer's compliance. **Foreign-buyer permit**: non-EU still need permit (Housing Act + Gov Decree 251/2014); ~30–45 day processing, ~€130–161 fee. EU citizens generally exempt. **eIDAS QES**: Ügyfélkapu, DÁP (Digitális Állampolgárság — new state digital-citizenship ID rolling out 2024–2026). **Land register**: ingatlan-nyilvántartás / TAKARNET / Földhivatal Online — fully electronic since 16 Jan 2025. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **SI** (Slovenia): **POA** = *pooblastilo*; OZ čl. 65–79. Property POA → notarised + apostilled if foreign. **Remote notarial signing**: ZN-H amendment (Uradni list RS 130/2022, 11 Oct 2022) created legal basis for *notar na daljavo*. Notary IT system "Notar na daljavo" was being procured Q4 2023 with **target go-live June 2025**. **Operational status as of 2026-05: not confirmed live** — search returned no go-live confirmation; target slipped per typical Slovenian e-justice rollout cadence. Verify with Notarska zbornica Slovenije before relying. **Slovenian quirk**: even when *notar na daljavo* is live, the **zemljiškoknjižno dovolilo** (land-register clausula intabulandi) will still be issued **on paper in physical form** despite parties having signed electronically via video. **eIDAS QES**: smart-ID, e-Davki cert, SIGEN-CA, SI-PASS. **Land register**: e-ZK, GURS — digital lookups; filing post-deed automated. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (statute HIGH; operational status not confirmed live).

- **HR** (Croatia): **POA** = *punomoć*; ZOO čl. 308–321. For property: notarised + apostilled if foreign. **Remote notarial signing**: Zakon o javnom bilježništvu 2021 amendment introduced electronic notarial deed at distance for **company-law acts** (Directive 2019/1151 transposition). **Property deeds: physical notary appearance still required** in 2026; remote scope hasn't been extended. **EU 2023+ dimension**: Croatia entered eurozone 1 Jan 2023. **eIDAS QES**: e-Građani, AAI@EduHr, Fina HZMO, Certilia. **Land register**: Zemljišnoknjižni odjel + e-Zemljišnik (ZK Online) — digital read; deed filed by notary. **Confidence**: HIGH on property still requiring physical signing.

- **RO** (Romania): **POA** = *procură*; NCC art. 2009–2030. Property POA must be in **autentic form** before a notary. Per UNNPR practice: **NOT POSSIBLE remotely** as of 2026 — physical presence at a Romanian notary OR Romanian consulate OR foreign Latin-system notary in autentic form + apostille. **Remote notarial signing reform — IN PROGRESS**: Ministry of Justice published a draft *Lege privind activitatea notarială electronică* (digital notarial-activity bill) for public consultation. Digital procedures will be performed via **Top-not** platform developed by UNNPR. **Not yet adopted** as of 2026-05. **Practical foreign-buyer pattern (2026)**: apostilled POA executed at RO consulate or before foreign notary (in autentic form) → mandatar signs deed at Bucharest/regional notary → ANCPI registration via ePay ANCPI portal. **eIDAS QES**: ROeID (rolling out 2024–2026 under PNRR), GhișeulRomâniei, certSIGN, DigiSign. **Land register**: ANCPI eTerra3 + ePay ANCPI — digital filing post-deed. **Confidence**: HIGH on current state (no remote property POA).

- **BG** (Bulgaria): **POA** = *пълномощно*; ZZD чл. 36–44. For property: **notarised power of attorney with notarisation of BOTH signature AND content** (per art. 37 ZZD post-2008 reform). If signed abroad: apostille + certified Bulgarian translation by sworn translator. **Remote notarial signing for property: NOT available**. ZNd чл. 569 mandates the notarial deed be executed before a Bulgarian notary with **territorial jurisdiction over the property's location** — physical signing in office. **Foreign-buyer pattern** (canonical): UK national buys EUR 120,000 coastal apartment → POA in London → FCDO apostille → attorney-in-fact in BG signs deed → Property Register registration same day; total 30–45 days. **2026 update**: from **15 Jan 2026** new restrictions on access to notarial-deed copies — only the parties' attorneys with written authorisation can request copies remotely. **eIDAS QES**: eAuth (egov.bg), KEP-issued QES (B-Trust, InfoNotary, Stampit, Evrotrust). **Land register**: kais.cadastre.bg + AV (Imotni Registar) — digital lookups; deed filed by notary same/next day. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **MD** (Moldova): **POA** = *procură*; Cod civil art. 264–272. For property: notarial form + apostille if abroad (or executed at MD consulate). **Remote notarial signing**: e-notariat pilot underway but as of 2026-05 not operational for property purchase. Both parties must be present at notary — or represented by notarial procură. **2025 cash-payment regime change**: Legea nr. 34/2024 from **1 April 2025** — property purchases above 100 average monthly wages (~€80,000) only by bank transfer (no cash). Phases down further to ~MDL 200,000 (~€10,000) by 1 Jan 2028. **eIDAS QES**: MPass + MSign + e-Apostila (e-Apostille operational since 2018; Moldova Hague Apostille member since 2007). Not yet eIDAS-notified for cross-border QES recognition with EU. **Land register**: ARFC eCadastru (cadastru.md) — digital lookups; registration of right of ownership 3–7 working days post-deed. **Confidence**: HIGH on POA path; MEDIUM on e-notar scope.

- **RS** (Serbia): **POA** = *punomoćje*; ZOO čl. 89–95. Property POA: two parallel forms offered at consulate — POA with *solemnizaciona klauzula* OR POA in form of *javnobeležnički zapis*. Both require physical presence at consulate. Foreign-notary executed POA: must be apostilled + sworn translation. **Remote notarial signing for property: NOT available**. Notary appearance in person. **Land register**: Republički geodetski zavod (RGZ) E-uvid katastar.rgz.gov.rs — digital lookups; deed registered post-signing via clausula intabulandi (uknjižbena dozvola). **Practitioner trap**: punomoćnik (attorney-in-fact) must be **explicitly authorised to give clausula intabulandi** in the POA text — a missing line voids registration. **eIDAS QES**: e-Uprava (eid.gov.rs) — domestically qualified; Serbia not eIDAS-notified for EU cross-border (2026). **Confidence**: HIGH on POA mechanics; HIGH on no-remote-signing reality.

- **ME** (Montenegro): **POA** = *punomoćje*; ZOO čl. 89–95 (mirror of RS). Notarial form + apostille (Hague member). MoJ apostille processing **up to 30 days**. **Remote notarial signing: NOT universally available** for property. **Foreign-buyer restriction**: Strangers cannot own agricultural/forest land >5,000 m², border-zone 1 km, islands. Apartments/houses on urban land OK. **eIDAS QES**: not yet eIDAS-notified for cross-border EU recognition (2026). **Land register**: Uprava za nekretnine (UN) e-katastar — digital lookups. **Confidence**: HIGH on no-remote-signing.

- **BA** (Bosnia and Herzegovina): **POA** = *punomoć*; entity-specific (FBiH OZ ZOO; RS ZOO). Property POA must be notarised; apostille usually required. Contract execution rules ALSO entity-specific: **FBiH** post-court-practice, lawyer-drafted contract with court-certified signatures may suffice (notarisation not strictly required per recent jurisprudence); **RS / Brčko Distrikt** contract MUST be a notarially-processed deed (*notarski obrađena isprava*) — failure → contract void. **Remote notarial signing: NOT available** in either entity for property. **Foreign-buyer reciprocity**: required between BIH and country of origin; agricultural land restrictions in some FBiH cantons. **eIDAS QES**: not eIDAS-notified. **Land register**: zk.pravosudje.ba (FBiH) / RGU RS — partial digitisation, varies by Land Registry Office. **Confidence**: HIGH on entity-specific deed-form.

- **MK** (North Macedonia): **POA** = *полномошно*; ZOO čl. 80–96. Property POA notarised + apostille (Hague member since 1991 succession from Yugoslavia). **Remote notarial signing: NOT available** for property. **eIDAS QES**: not eIDAS-notified for EU recognition. **Land register**: AKN katastar.gov.mk e-katastar — digital lookups for ownership/encumbrance. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (statute HIGH; data scarcity for remote-execution claim).

- **AL** (Albania): **POA** = *prokurë*; Civil Code art. 64+. Property POA must be notarised; foreign-issued POA must be apostilled (Hague member since 2003). **Remote notarial signing: NOT available** for property. Standard process: physical signing at Albanian notary; foreign buyer represented by lawyer holding apostilled POA. **eIDAS QES**: e-Albania (e-albania.al) — domestic only, not eIDAS-notified. **Land register**: ASHK (Agjencia Shtetërore e Kadastrës) e-portal (ashk.gov.al) — digital lookups; ownership certificate (Certifikata e Pronësisë) issued post-deed within days. **Foreign-buyer note**: foreigners can buy apartments/villas freely; agricultural land restricted (only via AL company); no border-zone restrictions in current practice. **Confidence**: HIGH on POA + no-remote.

## North America (US RON state-by-state, CA provincial)

### United States — RON state-by-state matrix

**Federal status**: NO federal RON statute as of 9 May 2026. **SECURE Notarization Act of 2025** reintroduced as **H.R. 1777** (3 Mar 2025, Energy & Commerce + Judiciary) and **S. 1561** (1 May 2025, Senate Judiciary). Both still in committee. Previous HR 1059 (118th Congress) passed House Feb 2023, died in Senate. **GSE acceptance**: Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac accept RON since joint announcement 31 Mar 2020 (formalised in Selling Guides); expanded for manufactured homes 7 Aug 2024 (Fannie SEL 24-04 / Freddie Bulletin 2024-7); MISMO RON Standards v1.x compliance required. **FHA / VA / USDA**: accept RON since 2021 (FHA Mortgagee Letter 2021-26; USDA Admin Notice 4805; VA Circular 26-21-15). **Hague Apostille**: US Hague signatory since 15 Oct 1981; RON deeds for use abroad still need apostille from the Secretary of State of the commissioning state.

**Tier 1 — Permanent RON, fully operational for real-estate deeds (~46 jurisdictions)**:

**Tier 2 — RON law on the books, NOT yet operational for deeds**:

| State | Statutory anchor | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **CA** | **Cal. Gov't Code §§ 8202-8205** (SB 696, 2023) | Recognition provisions effective 1 Jan 2024; **California-resident notaries CANNOT perform RON until Sec of State certifies platform OR by 1 Jan 2030 backstop**. As of May 2026 regulations still pending. CA recognises out-of-state RON for in-state recordation per § 8205. |
| DE | 29 Del. C. § 4329 | 14 Jul 2022 — permanent, but most lenders still treat DE RON cautiously |
| MS | Miss. Code § 25-34-101 | IPEN only; HB 1156 explicitly does NOT authorise RON; recognises out-of-state |

**Tier 3 — No permanent RON statute** (verify per-deal):

| State | Status | Out-of-state RON recognition |
|---|---|---|
| AL | No permanent RON; allows RIN/IPEN | Yes |
| GA | No permanent RON; emergency rules expired; DOR Admin-2025-03 limits | Recognises for general docs; **deeds: verify county clerk** |
| SC | S.C. Code § 26-2 (Electronic Notary Public Act, IPEN only) | Yes |

Net: 4 states do not authorise their own notaries to perform RON (AL, GA, MS, SC); all 4 recognise out-of-state RON for deed recordation, but GA county clerks have been the most variable.

**Foreign-buyer-specific traps**: KBA failure rate (foreign passport workaround in FL § 117.295); time-zone collision; witness requirements (FL/IL/NY 2 remote witnesses); lender residual wet-ink; county recorder rejection (GA/AL/SC); apostille on POA vs RON; real-estate carve-outs (state-specific deed exclusions).

**1 Mar 2026 — FinCEN Residential Real Estate Reporting Rule effective**: settlement / title / escrow / attorneys file Real Estate Reports for non-financed transfers to legal entities or trusts (any price, nationwide); beneficial-ownership disclosure (≥ 25% interest); gov-photo-ID copy of representative.

### Canada — provincial mosaic

- **POA statutes**: provincial. Ontario Substitute Decisions Act 1992; BC Power of Attorney Act + Power of Attorney Regulation; Alberta Powers of Attorney Act; Quebec Civil Code (mandate — civil-law province, separate); other provinces varying.
- **Hague Apostille**: Canada acceded **11 Jan 2024** — replaced consular legalisation chain.
- **e-conveyancing platforms**:
  - **Ontario — Teraview** (mandatory since c.2003); OnLand digital certification for Charge/Mortgage from **17 Jun 2024**.
  - **BC — myLTSA / LTSA Enterprise** (Land Title and Survey Authority) — fully electronic title registration.
  - **Alberta — SPIN II + ALTO**; modernization under Alberta Land Titles Modernization initiative.
  - **Quebec — Registre foncier** (digital, civil-law notarial chain).
- **Remote witnessing**:
  - **Ontario** — virtual VOI permanent from **1 Jan 2024** (Law Society of Ontario by-law amendment); remote commissioning of affidavits permanent.
  - **BC retired COVID remote witnessing 30 Sept 2023** — back to in-person rules under POA Act / Land Title Act unless new regulation. **TRAP**: foreign buyers must ensure POA was executed under standing POA Act formalities (including apostille post-2024-01-11).
  - Alberta, NS, others — varying retention.
- **Mortgage**: CIBC / RBC / TD / BMO / Scotiabank generally accept POA + solicitor for non-resident closings; foreign-buyer ban (Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act) extended to **1 Jan 2027**.
- **Foreign-buyer pattern**: Canadian lawyer (province-specific) + apostilled POA + e-conveyancing (Teraview/myLTSA/etc.) + bank-side ID via consular witness or video.
- **Confidence**: HIGH.

## Common-law Oceania (AU, NZ) + ZA + Caribbean

- **AU** (Australia): **POA** = state statutes; NSW Powers of Attorney Act 2003; Vic Instruments Act 1958 (Pt XI); Qld Powers of Attorney Act 1998; WA Guardianship and Administration Act 1990; SA Powers of Attorney and Agency Act 1984; Tas Powers of Attorney Act 2000. POAs do not auto-recognize across states. **e-conveyancing**: **PEXA** (NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, SA, ACT, NT — mandatory for most title transactions); **Sympli** approved as second ELNO but not adopted by major banks. Tasmania uses LIST. **PEXA + Sympli interoperability — SUSPENDED.** ARNECC published reviews 2025 finding "no compelling case"; banks warned 10% settlement-failure risk. NSW IPART rejected PEXA $1/txn fee Mar 2026. **Deed execution**: Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s38 amended to permit electronic creation/signing/attestation of deeds. **Remote witnessing made permanent in NSW** for deeds, POAs, wills, statutory declarations, affidavits — Electronic Transactions Amendment (Remote Witnessing) Act 2021. Vic/Qld also retained. **VOI**: ARNECC Model Participation Rules Schedule 8. Face-to-face is "Safe Harbour"; remote VOI via video may satisfy "reasonable steps." **Foreign buyers**: ARNECC + DFAT formal arrangement — Australian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate can perform VOI for overseas-located persons (both Australian and non-Australian nationals). **Mortgage**: **From 1 July 2025**, FRCGW $750k threshold abolished — all transactions need ATO clearance certificate or 15% withhold. **Foreign-buyer pattern**: Australian solicitor/conveyancer (PEXA member) + POA executed and witnessed at Australian consulate or via remote AVL + remote VOI through approved platform → settlement on PEXA without buyer flying in. **Trap**: FIRB approval required for foreign buyers of residential land — separate process; **2-year ban on foreign buyers of established dwellings** announced for 1 Apr 2025–31 Mar 2027. **Authority**: [pexa.com.au](https://www.pexa.com.au/), [arnecc.gov.au](https://www.arnecc.gov.au/), [legislation.nsw.gov.au](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/) (Conveyancing Act 1919). **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **NZ** (New Zealand): **POA statute**: Property Law Act 2007 (general POA), **Trustee Act 2019** (replaced 1956 Act), Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 (EPA). **e-conveyancing**: **Landonline** (LINZ) — mandatory e-dealing since 2002. Landonline rebuild ongoing — staged release of new system 2023-2026; **Database migration target Dec 2026**; legacy switched off for external users; access to final survey app ends 30 Sep 2026. **AML/CFT**: solicitor must perform CDD under AML/CFT Act 2009; RealMe + verified-agent flows for remote. **Foreign-ownership regime — UPDATED 2026**: Overseas Investment Act 2005 amended by Overseas Investment (National Interest Test and Other Matters) Amendment Act — **in force 6 Mar 2026**. Carve-out for AIP / Investor 1 / Investor 2 visa holders (and PR holders previously on those paths) to buy residential >NZ$5m. LINZ targets 5-day decisions. The 2018 blanket residential ban otherwise stands. **Foreign-buyer pattern**: NZ solicitor + POA + OIO consent (if applicable) + remote signing through Landonline. AML/CFT verification often via NZ embassy or Hague-Apostille-stamped document chain. **Confidence**: HIGH.

- **ZA** (South Africa): **POA statute**: General Law Amendment Act 50 of 1956 ss10-11 (formal validity of POAs to pass transfer); Notarial Practice. Foreign POAs require **apostille** (SA acceded to Hague Apostille 1995). **Conveyancer monopoly**: only an admitted conveyancer (Legal Practice Act 28 of 2014) may register transfer at Deeds Office. Foreign buyer always works through a SA conveyancer. **e-DRS (Electronic Deeds Registration System)** — **launched 1 April 2025** (Proclamation Notice 250 of 2025; sections 1, 3, 6 of Electronic Deeds Registration Systems Act 19 of 2019 in force). EDRS Regulations effective 4 Apr 2025. **Five-year dual-track transition** — manual and electronic in parallel; conveyancer's discretion. Premises move to Anderson St Marshalltown ~Sep 2026. **Foreign-buyer pattern**: SA conveyancer + apostilled POA "to pass transfer" (special POA naming the property) + apostilled supporting docs (passport, marriage status) + FX clearance via SARB Authorised Dealer. **Hawarden v ENS [2024] ZASCA 90 (10 Jun 2024)** — SCA **REVERSED** the High Court. Conveyancers do **NOT** owe purchasers a delictual duty to protect them from BEC where the purchaser had been warned of BEC risk and could verify bank details. **Practical effect**: BUYER carries the BEC loss; verify bank details out-of-band before any FX transfer. **Confidence**: MEDIUM (e-DRS in active rollout).

- **Caribbean**:
  - **BS** (Bahamas): Hague since 1973 (oldest in region). Bahamian attorney + Notary Public POA + apostille. Recording at Registrar General's Department. Foreign-buyer regime: International Persons Landholding Act 1993 — most residential under 5 acres exempt from permit.
  - **BB** (Barbados): Hague since 1966. Barbadian conveyancing-attorney + apostilled POA + Land Registry recording. CBB registration of foreign-exchange brought in.
  - **JM** (Jamaica): Hague **in force 3 July 2021** (deposited 2 Nov 2020). MFAFT issues, J$3,500/document, 5-day service. Jamaican attorney-at-law + apostilled POA + transfer instrument lodged at Registrar of Titles (NLA — Torrens system).
  - **BZ** (Belize): Hague Apostille **member** (the prompt's "OAS-not-Hague" claim is wrong — Belize uses Hague Apostille as standard route; also party to Inter-American Convention on POAs supplementary). Belizean attorney-at-law + apostilled POA + Registrar of Lands lodgement under Registered Land Act (Cap 194) or Law of Property Act (Cap 190). POA form prescribed by Ministry of Natural Resources.
  - **DO** (Dominican Republic, civil-law outlier): Hague since 30 Aug 2009. DR notario público + Registro de Títulos + DGII for 3% transfer tax. Foreign buyer needs passport + RNC tax ID. Remote purchase via apostilled "poder especial" to local lawyer is routine. Title vests on Registro de Títulos issuance (2-6 weeks). Trap: border-zone restrictions (national-security reserve area).

## Asia (JP, KR, CN, HK, MO, TW, SG, TH, MY, ID, VN, PH, IN, KH, LK, MV)

Mixed picture. Digital infrastructure is mature in SG/HK/JP/KR/CN (resident-anchored), but **most foreign-buyer flows still rely on POA + apostille / consular legalisation** because national e-IDs are not obtainable by non-residents. Two genuinely-remote-friendly outliers: **AE Federal Decree-Law 20/2022 video-notary** (covered under MENA below) and **TR vekaletname at consulate** (covered under MENA below).

- **JP** (Japan): Hague since 1970. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA = 委任状 under Civil Code Art. 99-118; 公証役場 notary. Process: foreign buyer signs POA at Japanese embassy/consulate abroad, OR signs before local notary + apostille. Three-step domestic chain when prepared abroad: notarise → Local Legal Affairs Bureau seal → MOFA apostille. Digital: My Number Card + マイナポータル — but property conveyancing is **wet-ink predominant**; e-signing not accepted at Legal Affairs Bureau (法務局) for title transfer.

- **KR** (South Korea): Hague since 2007. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA = 위임장; 공증사무소 notaries. Digital: 공인전자서명 / 공동인증서 (KISA-rooted); resident-only — no foreigner equivalent for full e-signing of deeds. ARC holders can register a 외국인등록증 e-cert. Process: POA notarised abroad + apostille → Korean attorney files at 등기소 (Registration Office). 2026 reform watch: foreign-buyer permit regime introduced for designated zones (Seoul metro housing).

- **CN** (China Mainland): Hague **since 7 Nov 2023**. **Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM**. POA = 委托书 + 公证. Foreign-buyer rule: 2010 one-property residency rule (must work/study in China ≥ 1 yr) — still in force. Digital: eID + Alipay/WeChat KYC are resident-anchored; e-conveyancing piloted in tier-1 cities only. FX: SAFE USD 50,000/yr personal quota; **Sept 2024 SAFE reform** removed "negative list" restriction on residential as investment asset and lets overseas buyers convert + down-pay before registration certificate. Process: foreign buyer signs POA at PRC embassy/consulate → since 7 Nov 2023, apostille from Hague-state competent authority is accepted (replacing two-step consular legalisation).

- **HK** (Hong Kong SAR): Hague (extension). **Confidence: HIGH** (mature solicitor-led conveyancing). POA: Powers of Attorney Ordinance Cap. 31; Conveyancing & Property Ordinance Cap. 219. Solicitor-led under Law Society of Hong Kong. Digital: iAM Smart (resident-only), Land Registry e-Search ([landregistry.gov.hk](https://www.landregistry.gov.hk/)) — full title search remote. Process: foreign buyer signs SPA and Assignment via solicitor + POA witnessed by HK consulate or notary + apostille. E-signing for property documents not standard — wet-ink before solicitor remains the norm. 2024 update: BSD/SSD/AVD scrapped 28 Feb 2024 for non-permanent residents.

- **MO** (Macao SAR): Hague (extension). **Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM**. POA + apostille; deed signed before Macao notary. DSAJ (Direcção dos Serviços de Assuntos de Justiça).

- **TW** (Taiwan): **Non-Hague** (uses TECRO/TECO authentication). **Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM**. POA = 委任書 + 公證. Digital: TAIWAN ID Citizen Digital Certificate — nationals only. Process: foreign buyer signs POA at TECRO/TECO office abroad → Taiwan attorney files at Land Office (地政事務所).

- **SG** (Singapore): Hague since 2021. **Confidence: HIGH**. Statute: Powers of Attorney Act 1996; Conveyancing and Law of Property Act; solicitor-led under Law Society of Singapore. Digital: Singpass + MyInfo (residents/EP holders); **Singpass Foreign User Account (SFA)** since 2023 — but SFA is issuance-agency-locked (an SFA from IRAS only works on IRAS, not SLA), so it does NOT enable a foreign buyer to e-sign deeds via Singpass. Process: foreign buyer's solicitor handles conveyancing remotely; SPA signed at SG embassy/HCM/notary + apostille. **E-Lodgment** for caveats/titles is solicitor-side. 2024 update: ABSD 60% for foreign buyers (since 27 Apr 2023) — cost layer, not execution.

- **TH** (Thailand): **Non-Hague** (Cabinet approved 9 Dec 2025; instrument NOT YET deposited as of 9 May 2026 — still consular legalisation only). **Confidence: LOW**. POA = หนังสือมอบอำนาจ; Land Department under Ministry of Interior. Foreign-buyer rules: 49% condo cap (Condominium Act §19); land ownership prohibited (BOI/leasehold/Thai-Co structures only). Digital: ThaID e-ID is resident-anchored. Process: POA notarised at Thai embassy/consulate → submitted with deed at Land Office. Until apostille deposit, two-step consular legalisation chain is the only path.

- **MY** (Malaysia): Hague since 1991. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA: Powers of Attorney Act 1949 (s.5 — execution abroad must be authenticated by consul/notary public); state-level Land (Powers of Attorney) Acts. Digital: MyDigital ID rolled out 2024 (resident-anchored). Foreign-buyer rules: state-specific minimum prices (RM 1m–2m typical). Process: POA executed before MY High Commission/notary + apostille; deed registered at state Land Office.

- **ID** (Indonesia): Hague since 4 Jun 2022. **Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM**. POA = surat kuasa; UU 5/1960 + UU Cipta Kerja 11/2020. **Hak Pakai** for individual foreigners (KITAS/KITAP holders); **PT PMA** structure for corporate ownership of HGB. Digital: e-KTP + DUKCAPIL (resident-only); BPN's e-Sertifikat (since 2019) rolling out. **2025 reform**: BKPM Reg 5/2025 raised PT PMA paid-up capital to **IDR 2.5 bn** (~USD 150k). Process: foreign buyer signs surat kuasa before notaris (PPAT) — must be physically present OR signs at ID embassy abroad + apostille. Remote video-witnessing **not recognised** for AJB (deed of sale).

- **VN** (Vietnam): Hague **in force 11 Sept 2026** (deposited 31 Dec 2025; consular until then). **Confidence: LOW**. POA = ủy quyền; **Law on Housing 2023 (Law 27/2023/QH15) + Decree 95/2024/ND-CP**, in force 1 Jan 2025. Foreign-buyer cap: **30% of apartments per condominium block**; max **250 landed houses per ward-equivalent area**. 50-yr ownership term, renewable. Digital: VNeID rolling out (resident-anchored). Process: foreign buyer's POA notarised at VN embassy → consular legalisation at MOFA HCMC/HN until 11 Sept 2026, then apostille from Hague state.

- **PH** (Philippines): Hague since 14 May 2019. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA = Special Power of Attorney (SPA) under Civil Code Arts. 1878-1879; Land Registration Authority (LRA). Foreign-buyer rule: 40% condo cap (RA 4726); land ownership prohibited (former natural-born Filipinos exempt). Digital: PhilSys eID rolling out; LRA eSerbisyo for certified true copies (CTC) of titles online. Process: SPA notarised abroad → apostille → Register of Deeds where property sits.

- **IN** (India): Hague since 14 May 2005. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA: Indian Stamp Act + Registration Act 1908. Digital: DigiLocker + Aadhaar eKYC (resident-only). Process: foreign buyer's PoA executed before Indian consulate (preferred) OR notarised + apostilled → registered at sub-registrar office. Specific (not general) PoA registered + apostilled is the practitioner-recommended pattern. State RERA filing for new construction. NRO/NRE accounts for FX. **TCS LRS 20%** (covered in `--home-tax`).

- **KH** (Cambodia): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: LOW**. POA under Civil Code 2007; foreign individuals can own strata-title from 2nd floor up (Foreign Ownership Property Law 2010); land ownership prohibited. Process: POA notarised at KH embassy → MFA legalisation → recipient ministry. Hard Title required.

- **LK** (Sri Lanka): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: LOW**. POA under Notaries Ordinance. Foreign-buyer rules: Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act No. 38 of 2014 + 2017 amendment — 99-yr lease only.

- **MV** (Maldives): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: LOW**. No freehold for foreigners; 50–99 yr leasehold only (Constitutional Amendment 2015 + Land Act). Process: full consular legalisation chain.

---

## Central Asia + Caucasus (KZ, UZ, AM, AZ, GE)

- **KZ** (Kazakhstan): Hague since 30 Jan 2001. **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH** (residents); LOW-MEDIUM (foreigners). POA = doverennost' (доверенность); Notarial Law 2025; eGov.kz portal. Digital: **eGov Mobile + Digital Notary (e-Notar)** — POA via video-call to notary with biometric ID + e-signature, since 2022. Resident-anchored (IIN required). **Critical limitation**: property alienation transactions (sales) **still require physical participation** — only powers/consents/applications can be processed via Digital Notary. Process for foreign buyer: POA + apostille → KZ attorney executes deed at notary in person.

- **UZ** (Uzbekistan): Hague since 23 Apr 2012. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA = ishonchnoma; e-Notarius platform launched 2022. Digital: MyGov + MyID (resident-anchored).

Process: foreign buyer POA notarised abroad + e-apostille → executed by GE attorney at PSH. PSH offers in-person turnaround in 1–4 days for property registration; foreigners welcome (no nationality restriction on most residential land).

---

## MENA (IL, AE, SA, QA, BH, KW, OM, JO, LB, EG, TN, MA, TR)

- **IL** (Israel): Hague since 14 Aug 1978. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA = ייפוי כוח under Notaries Law 5736-1976; Land Authority (RMI). Process: POA + apostille → IL attorney at Tabu (טאבו) Land Registry.

- **AE** (UAE): **Non-Hague** (signed Mar 2024 but instrument deposit unverified May 2026 — verify at HCCH). **Confidence: HIGH** (best-in-class digital, but legalisation chain remains because of non-Hague status). 🟢 Statute: **Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2022** unified federal notary law; Federal Decree-Law No. 46 of 2021 validates e-signatures equivalent to wet-ink. Digital: UAE Pass (resident); ADJD Notary Public + private notaries; **video-conference POA notarisation explicitly authorised** — applicant verifies ID via live video to UAE notary. **DIFC Oct 2024**: DIFC Courts Notary Service launched 3 modes — automated e-notary, live virtual via video, in-person. Process: two paths — (1) UAE consulate legalisation chain abroad ~USD 1,500–3,500; OR (2) **video-notarisation directly with a UAE notary** for the POA, bypassing legalisation entirely (since 2022).

- **SA** (Saudi Arabia): Hague **since 7 Dec 2022**. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. Notarisation under MoJ Saudi Arabia; foreign ownership governed by 2000 Royal Decree M/15 + reforms. Digital: Absher + Nafath (resident-anchored); Saudi Pass. Process post-7-Dec-2022: foreign buyer POA notarised abroad + apostille from Hague state → MoJ-licensed Saudi notary executes deed.

- **QA / BH / KW / OM**: Non-Hague. Standard consular legalisation chain. **OM** has ITC (Integrated Tourism Complex) freehold zones for foreigners (RD 12/2006). **KW** essentially blocks foreign individual freehold.

- **JO / LB / EG**: Non-Hague; consular legalisation. **LB**: banking system collapse adds friction beyond legalisation — BdL Basic Decision 13729 (1 Jul 2025) freezes pre-17 Nov 2019 FX accounts; capital controls effectively in place. Funding leg is the bottleneck, not the deed.

- **TN** (Tunisia): Hague since 24 Jul 2017. POA + apostille → TN notary executes.

- **MA** (Morocco): Hague since 14 Aug 2016. POA + apostille → notaire/adoul executes; ANCFCC (Cadastre) registers.

- **TR** (Turkey): Hague since 29 Sep 1985. **Confidence: HIGH** (one of the most operationally remote-friendly markets for foreign buyers). 🟢 Statute: Vekaletname (POA) — must be prepared at Turkish consulate abroad (preferred) OR notarised + apostilled. Digital: **e-Devlet ([turkiye.gov.tr](https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/)) + e-İmza**; **TAPU** Land Registry digital — `webtapu.tkgm.gov.tr`. e-TAPU has same legal validity as paper. Foreign-buyer rules: military zone clearance auto-initiated by Land Registry on receipt of foreign application; reciprocity list (~183 countries permitted). Process: foreign buyer issues vekaletname at TR consulate (1 day) → TR attorney completes TAPU transfer remotely. **Entire purchase routinely closed without buyer setting foot in Turkey.**

---

## Latin America (MX, BR, AR, CL, CO, PE, UY, EC, PY, CR, PA)

- **MX** (Mexico): Hague since 14 Aug 1995. **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**. Poder notarial; **fideicomiso** mandatory for foreign individual ownership of residential property in restricted zone (50 km coast / 100 km border, Constitutional Art. 27 + Foreign Investment Law 1993). 50-yr trust, indefinitely renewable. Process: foreign buyer's poder notarial executed at MX consulate OR locally + apostille → notario público executes deed; bank trustee for fideicomiso (BBVA/Banorte/Scotia typical).

- **BR** (Brazil): Hague since 14 Aug 2016. **Confidence: HIGH**. 🟢 procuração; **e-Notariado** ([e-notariado.org.br](https://www.e-notariado.org.br/)) — national platform launched 2020 under CNJ Provimento 100/2020, expanded under Provimento 149/2023. Digital: gov.br (resident); ICP-Brasil certificate OR **notarised digital certificate** issued via video-conference at any accredited notary office. **Procuração eletrônica fully valid for property transactions.** Process: foreign buyer obtains notarised digital certificate via video-conference with BR notary → signs procuração eletrônica → BR attorney executes escritura de compra e venda → registers at Cartório de Registro de Imóveis.

- **AR** (Argentina): Hague since 18 Feb 1988. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. Poder; CDI (Clave de Identificación) issued by **ARCA** (formerly AFIP, renamed 2024) required for foreign buyer to execute escritura. Process: poder notarised abroad + apostille + sworn translation by AR national translator → AR attorney secures CDI and executes escritura at escribano público. **No physical presence required.**

- **CL** (Chile): Hague since 30 Aug 2016. Poder + apostille → CL notario; conveyancing at Conservador de Bienes Raíces.

- **CO** (Colombia): Hague since 30 Jan 2001. Poder + apostille → notaría → registro de instrumentos públicos.

- **PE** (Peru): Hague since 30 Sep 2010. Poder + apostille → notaría → SUNARP registry.

- **UY** (Uruguay): Hague since 14 Oct 2012. Poder + apostille → escribano público → Registro Nacional.

- **EC** (Ecuador): Hague since 2 Apr 2005. Poder + apostille → notaria → registro de la propiedad.

- **PY** (Paraguay): Hague since 30 Aug 2014. Poder + apostille → escribano público.

- **CR** (Costa Rica): Hague since 14 Dec 2011. **Poder Generalísimo** (the only POA accepted for Registro Nacional property procedures since 2025 Constitutional Court ruling — Special Powers no longer accepted). Indefinitely valid until revoked. Digital: **Firma Digital BCCR** — only issued to CR citizens or DIMEX-holding residents; foreign buyers cannot obtain it. Process: foreign buyer signs Poder Generalísimo before notario público (must travel to CR) OR at CR consulate abroad → registered before Registro Nacional.

- **PA** (Panama): Hague since 4 Aug 1991. Poder notarial + apostille → notario → Registro Público.

- **DO** (Dominican Republic): covered above under Caribbean.

---

## Africa (NG, KE, GH, RW, MU, SC, CV, ZA — covered above)

- **NG** (Nigeria): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: LOW**. POA under Land Use Act 1978 + state Lands Bureau; Governor's Consent required for transfers. Process: POA notarised abroad → NG embassy legalisation → MFA Abuja authentication.

- **KE** (Kenya): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: MEDIUM** (Ardhisasa is well-implemented domestically, but apostille gap forces legalisation chain for foreign-issued docs). Statute: Land Registration Act 2012; **Ardhisasa** ([ardhisasa.lands.go.ke](https://ardhisasa.lands.go.ke/)) — National Land Information System operational since 27 Apr 2021. Land Registration (General) (Amendment) Regs 2024 reinforced electronic-transactions framework. Process: foreign buyer POA must go through full **consular legalisation** since KE is non-Hague. Attorney then files via Ardhisasa. Foreign-buyer rule: Constitution 2010 — non-citizens leasehold up to 99 yrs only, no freehold.

- **GH** (Ghana): **Non-Hague**. **Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM**. POA under Conveyancing Act 1973. Digital: Ghana Card + NIA (resident). Process: POA via consular legalisation → Lands Commission registration.

- **RW** (Rwanda): Hague **since 5 Jun 2024**. **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH** (best-in-class East African digital + new Hague status). 🟢 POA under Civil Code; foreign nationals can buy under 99-yr emphyteutic lease. Digital: **Irembo / IremboGov** ([irembo.gov.rw](https://irembo.gov.rw/)) — full e-services portal; **NLA electronic land registration certificate system** allows online land services for diaspora without third-party POA. **e-Apostille** issued via Irembo since June 2024 by MINAFFET. Process: foreign buyer POA + apostille (now from Hague state) → RW attorney via Irembo platform; many transactions filed direct without POA via diaspora-accessible Irembo login.

- **MU** (Mauritius): Hague since 20 Dec 1968. **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**. POA under Civil Code; foreign-buyer programmes (PDS / IRS / RES / Smart City) regulated by EDB. Digital: MauPass (resident). Process: POA + apostille → notaire → Registrar General.

- **SC** (Seychelles): Hague since 31 Mar 1979. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. POA + Sanction (Government Sanction required for foreign land acquisitions). Sanction is the typical bottleneck, not legalisation.

- **CV** (Cape Verde): Hague since 10 Jun 2009. **Confidence: MEDIUM**. procuração; MFA + DGRN as competent authorities; **e-apostille available** via Portal Consular ([portalconsular.mnec.gov.cv](https://portalconsular.mnec.gov.cv/)).

## Cross-cutting structural detail

The 7 traps surfaced at the top of this doc each map to a deeper analysis:

### eIDAS-2 (Reg (EU) 2024/1183) — EUDI Wallet rollout
- Published OJEU **30 Apr 2024**; entered into force **20 May 2024**.
- First Implementing Acts adopted **4 Dec 2024**.
- **At least one EUDI Wallet must be available in each Member State by ~Dec 2026** (24 months after IA adoption).
- **Mandatory acceptance** by Very Large Online Platforms + specified private-sector relying parties + cross-border-mobility services by **~Dec 2027**.
- For property buyers this means a usable EU-wide identity wallet for cross-border POA / eID flows is in pilot through 2026 and operational from 2027 — **but does not on its own enable remote property deed signing** where national notarial law still requires physical presence.

### MISMO RON Standards (US lender side)
For US holders, GSE acceptance requires MISMO RON compliance: credential analysis, multi-factor identity proofing (KBA OR biometric+credential), tamper-evident e-seal, audio-video session retention ≥ 10 yrs, secure custody of journal. Approved-vendor visibility lives in seller/servicer guides (Fannie Mae Selling Guide B8-7-01; Freddie Mac Bulletin 2020-8 + subsequent).

### ARNECC VOI for AU (foreign-buyer pattern)
ARNECC + DFAT formal arrangement — Australian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate can perform VOI for overseas-located persons (both Australian and non-Australian nationals), for ELN and paper transactions. Cleanest model globally for cross-border identity-verification.

### HMLR ID standards (UK)
HMLR's published terminology: **ID1 / ID2 + Digital ID Standard** (Safe Harbour) per Practice Guide 67. Conveyancer following the standard discharges identity-verification duty against HMLR recourse claims. Voluntary; other VOI methods remain valid. NOT the "DIV1/DIV2/DIV3" terminology sometimes seen in third-party guides — those are not HMLR's published terms.

---

## Universal mitigations (apply across all home jurisdictions)

These work regardless of the property country and prevent the most common cross-border execution pitfalls:

1. **Default to local representative + apostilled POA, not real-time video.** Works in all 103 countries, eliminates the time-zone problem (Trap #3), sidesteps deed-execution gaps (Trap #1), and is the cleanest fit for AML/KYC gatekeepers (Trap #7). Real-time RON / videoconferencia is for narrow situations where lender or jurisdiction *requires* borrower-direct signing.

2. **Verify mortgage-lender's RON / remote-mortgage acceptance in writing BEFORE the loan estimate.** GSE acceptance ≠ originator acceptance ≠ warehouse-line acceptance ≠ recorder acceptance. Get all four confirmed (Fannie/Freddie + lender + warehouse + recording county) for US deals; for EU deals, verify *deed* and *mortgage-instrument* acceptance separately.

3. **Use the destination country's consulate to draft the POA where available.** Civil-law consulates abroad (FR, IT, ES, PT, DE, AT, NL, BE, LU, GR, CY, PL, CZ, MX, BR, AR, CO, CL, PE, TR, IL — verify availability and slot capacity in your buyer's residence-country consulate) draft POA in destination language directly, bypassing apostille AND sworn-translation steps. Saves 2-4 weeks vs. domestic notary + apostille + translator chain. Consulate slots in major cities (London, NYC, Dubai, Singapore) book 4-8 weeks out — book before you have a property under offer.

4. **For non-Hague jurisdictions, plan apostille / consular-legalisation chain 4-8 weeks ahead.** Non-Hague as of May 2026: AE (verify HCCH deposit), EG, JO, KW, LB, QA, NG, KE, GH, TW, KH, LK, MV, MY, **TH** (until accession deposit + ~12 mo), **VN** (until 11 Sept 2026). Calendar-actionable: VN flips to apostille on 11 Sept 2026; mark this date and recalculate buyer timelines.

5. **Verify destination-country deed-execution scope BEFORE relying on QES / RON.** Deed-execution gaps exist even in eIDAS-2 jurisdictions: DE Auflassung, IT rogito, NL akte van levering, AT real-estate sale, CH most cantons, ES compraventa, MT all sales — all require physical / notary-presence steps in May 2026. Confirm with the destination notary chamber: BNotK (DE), CNN (IT), CSN (FR), CGN (ES), KNB (NL), ÖNK (AT), MOKK (HU). Their published guidance binds practitioners.

6. **Run an identity-verification dry run 2-3 weeks before signing.** KBA failures dominate the foreign-buyer scenario for US RON; document-verification + biometric-liveness vendors (NotaryCam, Proof, Notarize) have credential-analysis fallbacks but require pre-registration. For ARNECC VOI in Australia, the consulate appointment slot is the long pole — book it before signing day. For UK HMLR, confirm conveyancer's chosen vendor (Thirdfort, Onfido, Yoti) supports the buyer's passport country before instructing.

7. **Watch the BEC trap on FX transfer leg.** *Hawarden v ENS* [2024] ZASCA 90 (10 Jun 2024) — South African SCA held buyer bears BEC loss where bank details could have been verified out-of-band. Verify wire instructions on an independently-sourced number (law-society directory, official registry, NOT the email signature). FBI IC3 2024 — $2.77B BEC losses across 21,442 complaints. Cross-references `--scams` cross-cutting trap #1.

## Honest uncertainties (read before relying)

- **CA SB 696 effective 1 Jan 2030** — Sec of State retains authority to delay further if regulations not ready by 1 Jan 2029; verify CLIN + ALTA tracking before relying.
- **US SECURE Notarization Act** — fluid; status changes Congress-by-Congress; verify current bill number.
- **NL Wet digitale processen Notariaat** — bill in pipeline; verify [tweedekamer.nl](https://www.tweedekamer.nl/) for current status.
- **LU digitalisation-of-notariat bill** — status unverified May 2026; treat LU as POA-only until enacted.
- **SI Notar na daljavo** — target Jun 2025 slipped; operational status not confirmed live as of May 2026.
- **TH Hague Apostille deposit** — cabinet approved Dec 2025; verify HCCH deposit monthly.
- **AE Hague Apostille deposit** — signed Mar 2024; verify HCCH deposit status.
- **PL foreign remote POA rejection** — iNPN 1(98)/2025 doctrine; practitioner risk highest in PL; verify with Polish notary before signing remote POA elsewhere.
- **Hawarden v ENS** — SCA ruling REVERSED High Court; buyer bears BEC risk; verify current status of any further appeals to Constitutional Court.

## Status

**Confidence (overall)**: HIGH for the cited statutes and primary forms across most cohorts; MEDIUM for items in active 2026 reform (NL Wet WRBox3 / SI Notar na daljavo / US CA SB 696 / US SECURE Act / TH-AE Hague Apostille / LU digitalisation); LOW flagged inline (LB banking collapse / KW foreign individual freehold / KP-MM-SY sanctions/conflict).

**Last verified**: 2026-05-09.

**Re-verify cadence**: every 6 months — these jurisdictions all have active e-conveyancing reforms that move scope. eIDAS-2 EUDI Wallet rollout, US CA SB 696 implementation, NL Wet digitale processen, AU PEXA-Sympli interoperability, ZA e-DRS phase 2, TH+AE Hague deposit should be re-checked **after each parliamentary milestone**, not just on the 6-month timer.

**Re-stamp triggers (calendar-actionable)**:
- 2026-09-11: VN Hague Apostille in force.
- 2026-09-30: NZ Landonline final survey app cutoff.
- 2026-10: TH Hague Apostille deposit watch.
- 2026-12: NZ Landonline database migration target.
- 2026-12: EU eIDAS-2 EUDI Wallet member-state availability deadline.
- 2027-01-01: NL 30%-ruling flat 27% (cross-references `--home-tax`).
- 2027-12: EU eIDAS-2 mandatory acceptance.
- 2027: US Federal SECURE Notarization Act re-introduction watch.
- 2028: NL Wet digitale processen Notariaat target.
- 2029-01-01: CH Eigenmietwert abolished (cross-references `--home-tax`).
- 2030-01-01: US CA SB 696 RON full effective date backstop.
