# Universal `--mains` Section — Utilities Reliability Extension

Grid reliability + outage profile + load-shedding regime + 2024-2026 reform calendar + water-supply reliability for the property's country. Loaded when `--mains` is invoked alongside the per-country sewer/drain connection logic in each country playbook.

**Snapshot**: May 2026.

**Scope**: this doc supplies the *reliability* layer — how often the grid goes down, for how long, under what regime, and what reforms are imminent. The *connection* layer (which utilities exist, how to verify a parcel is connected, septic-vs-sewer thresholds) lives in each country's playbook `--mains` section.

## Universal contract

## ⚠️ 7 cross-cutting traps

1. **SAIDI excludes rare extreme events in some methodologies** — Spain/Portugal use TIEPI/NIEPI not SAIDI; FR Enedis distinguishes "criteria B" (incl. exceptional) from "criteria A"; Italian ARERA varies by zone. Comparing raw numbers across countries can mislead — check methodology.
2. **Island grids = single-point-of-failure tail risk** — IS (2 Oct 2024 storm), TW (Apr 2024 near-blackout, 3% reserve), CY, MT, MV outer islands, BS Family Islands, BZ (CFE-import dependency). Top-tier reliability in most years masks catastrophic-event risk.
3. **Synchronous decoupling reshapes everything** — Baltic states (EE/LV/LT) desynchronised from BRELL 8 Feb 2025 + synchronised with Continental EU 9 Feb 2025; SAIDI improved sharply (EE 142 min 2024 vs 453 min 2023). Equally, Iberian peninsula's weak FR-ES tie (~5% peak) caused 28 Apr 2025 ~10 hr blackout. Grid topology > generation mix when crisis hits.
4. **Hydro-dependency = drought-correlated outage risk** — EC (78% hydro), CO (87% normal → 47% Apr 2024), CR (99% normal → 86% Q2 2024 drought), BR (worst-recorded 2024 drought), AL (98% hydro), CN-Sichuan (2022 anchor), VN-north summer. A "🟢 in normal year" rating can flip 🔴 in a drought year.
5. **Tariff capping = silent outage subsidy** — HU rezsicsökkentés, AR Decree 55/2023 emergency subsidies, EG freeze through Jun 2026, KZ multi-year cap 2026-2032: when residential tariffs are political, utilities defer capex, outages worsen 2-3 years later. Look for tariff-vs-CPI gap.
6. **Water-shedding shadows load-shedding** — ZA Gauteng water-shedding parallel to Eskom load-shedding since 2022; LB Litani 2024-25 inflows -80% vs avg + EDL collapse; MA 7th drought year + electricity reliability OK; ES Catalonia + Andalusia drought emergencies through 2024; RO ANAR rationed 449 localities 2024; BG 5.8% population on rationing 2024 (Pleven 51%, Lovech 56%). Foreign buyers should NOT assume "electricity reliability OK = water OK".
7. **Tariff bands ≠ service-hour bands ≠ outage bands** — NG Apr 2024 introduced Bands A (20+ hr/day promised) / B (16) / C (12) / D (8) / E (4). 9 DisCos ordered to compensate Band A customers Apr 2025 for failing the 20-hr commitment. The marketed band is the price tier; the delivered hours are a separate question. Same applies to Caribbean utilities (BPL Family Islands, JPS Jamaica).

## Regional patterns

### Western Europe + microstates

Synchronous Continental Europe + Nordic + GB-island + IS-island + IE All-Island. Tier-1 reliability: DE (11.7 min 2024), DK (27, 2024), CH, NL, AT, NO transmission. Tier-2: FR (71.6 min 2024 — climate regression), UK (39.71), IE, IT mainland.

**Defining 2024-2026 events**:

- **28 Apr 2025 Iberian peninsula blackout** — voltage-control failure + Granada substation transformer overvoltage trip; 56M+ people, ~10 hr typical recovery (up to 20 hr in some islands and zones); >€1.6 bn estimated economic loss. ENTSO-E expert panel final report 20 Mar 2026 attributed root cause to systemic voltage control + reactive power gaps; renewables share NOT root cause.
- **NL grid congestion crisis** — TenneT 38 GW waitlist Q1 2025; new kWmaxweighted tariff Jan 2025; redispatch obligation ≥60 MW.
- **DE Redispatch reform** — €2.2 bn grid-management costs Q1-3 2025; AgNes process mid-2026; new fee regime from 1 Jan 2029.
- **UK NESO launch 1 Oct 2024** — £630m public acquisition of National Grid ESO division.
- **CH Stromgesetz / Mantelerlass referendum 9 Jun 2024** (68.72% Yes); Energy Act amendments effective 1 Jan 2025; Electricity Supply Act amendments effective 1 Jan 2026.
- **IS Jan-Apr 2024 H6 hydro curtailment** — Landsvirkjun curtailed industrial loads 19 Jan – 30 Apr 2024 (water-level-driven); plus 2 Oct 2024 storm outage worst since 2019.
- **IE winter 2024-25 LOLE 3.6h vs 3h standard** — peak demand record 6,024 MW (8 Jan 2025).

### CEE + Western Balkans + Baltics

Three sub-tiers:

- **Baltics (EE/LV/LT) post-9 Feb 2025**: synchronisation-with-CE complete; permanent ENTSO-E RG-CE membership 25 Nov 2025. SAIDI improved sharply (EE 142 min 2024 vs 453 min 2023; LT 121 min 2024 vs 399 min 2023).
- **CE-EU members (PL/CZ/SK/HU/RO/BG/SI/HR)**: synchronous-CE-EU, generally robust. Two flagship 2024-2025 incidents:
  - **Balkan cascade 21 Jun 2024** — HOPS overhead lines tripped on overgrown vegetation under 42°C heat, ~3h outage across HR-Adriatic + BA + ME + AL. ENTSO-E final report Q1 2025 confirmed cause as vegetation, NOT heatwave alone.
  - **CZ blackout 4 Jul 2025** — ČEPS V411 line phase-conductor rupture, 2,700 MW lost (~⅓ of national load), ~10h restoration, ~CZK 0.75bn damage.
- **Western Balkans non-EU (RS/ME/BA/MK/AL)**: SMM/Continental Europe synchronous; weaker grids; capacity-shortage exposure (especially AL hydro-dominant — 80% import dependency in 2024 drought).
- **MD**: post-2022 emergency synchronisation with Romania; **Jan-Feb 2025 acute crisis** when Russian gas transit via UA ended 31 Dec 2024, Cuciurgan/Kuchurgan plant in Transnistria stopped supplying MD on 1 Jan 2025 (had been 70-90% historically); RO emergency imports activated.

**Water reliability is the binding constraint in the south**: BG had **5.8% of population under rationing in 2024** (Pleven 51%, Lovech 56%, Pernik 83% network losses); RO ANAR rationed 449 localities (15%) across 12+ counties; HU's Tisza basin and Great Plain under recurring drought; AL hydropower-dependent (98% generation) means dry years trigger 80% import dependency.

### Anglo non-EU

- **US 2024**: ~660 min (~11 hours) avg per EIA — nearly 2× the prior-decade average; SC peaked at ~53 hours. 80% of 2024 outage hours hurricane-driven (Beryl Jul / Helene Sep / Milton Oct). Without major events, median ~2 hours.
- **CA**: Hydro-Québec 436 min 2024 (-50% YoY); AB 2024 wildfires worst by ignition count (1,210+ fires, 705,000 ha); Jan 2024 cold-snap nearly triggered AESO rolling outages.
- **AU**: ~1.5 outages/customer/yr SAIFI (NEM avg, AEMC FY2024); AEMO 2025 ESOO flags QLD 80 MW gap 2025-26 + SA 390 MW gap 2026-27 (Torrens B retirement); Capacity Investment Scheme underwriting 50+ GW new build.
- **NZ**: winter 2024 wholesale price shocks triggered MBIE-commissioned independent review; Cabinet response Sep 2025; from 1 Apr 2026: Vector +7.8% wtd, Aurora +21%; LNG import facility procurement reported to Cabinet Dec 2025.

## Universal mitigations

For foreign buyers, applicable across all 103 countries:

1. **Verify the EAF / SAIDI delta vs national-policy claim** — utilities often publish flattering averages while specific feeders / districts run far worse. Always check the specific suburb / commune / district feeder via local regulator.
2. **Budget for backup**: Tier-3+4 markets (LB, NG, GH, EC, CO during drought, KH, IN rural, Caribbean Family Islands, MV outer islands) require diesel/petrol generator OR Starlink-grade UPS + battery + solar buffer. Pricing: $5k-$30k upfront depending on size.
3. **Cross-reference water reliability** — the 7th cross-cutting trap. Don't assume electricity-OK = water-OK. Same drought hits both. Check municipal water-rationing schedule + reservoir levels before signing.
4. **Verify generation-mix exposure** — hydro-dominant markets (EC, CO, CR, BR, AL, CN-Sichuan, VN-north, NO) flip 🟢→🔴 in dry years. Get the most-recent reservoir levels before reliance.
5. **Insurance + business-interruption riders** — extended outage events not always covered under standard property policy; verify rider availability for grid-failure-induced losses (food spoilage, business interruption, sump-pump failure → flood damage).
6. **Tariff trajectory > current rate** — cheap tariff today can reflect under-investment that will surface as future outages OR steep hikes (KZ 2026-2032 caps, NG band-A vs band-E, EG freeze ending Jun 2026, ZA NERSA 2026-2027). Look at multi-year regulator decisions, not last-bill snapshot.
7. **Strata / HOA backup-power infrastructure** — apartment buildings in Tier-3+4 markets often have shared diesel generators with maintenance-fund implications. Verify generator condition + fuel-storage compliance + monthly service-fund accrual before bidding.

## Confidence labels

- **HIGH**: SAIDI/SAIFI from official regulator within 12 months; reform calendar cited via legal instrument; events documented in primary or major secondary source. Applies to: most Western Europe, US, JP, KR, TW, HK, MO, SG, ZA-electricity, NG, KE, CL, BR, EC, CO, MX, AR, IN-electricity-events.
- **MEDIUM**: Qualitative reliability characterisation strong; numeric SAIDI not publicly headlined OR data is in local-language regulator reports not extracted; events well-documented. Applies to: many CEE/Balkans, AU, NZ-quantitative, MY, ID, VN, PH, IN-DISCOM-numeric, RW, GE, AM, AZ, MU, SC, CV, GH-quantitative, TR-numeric, JO-numeric, OM, BH.
- **LOW**: Numeric SAIDI not publicly available; inheritance assumption from host grid; event-level data thin. Applies to: SM (no separate publication; IT-grid-embedded), AD/MC/LI (microstate limited publication), MV outer-islands (sparse data), TN-numeric, BA-numeric, AL-numeric, KH-numeric.

**Coverage gaps** (3 countries pending follow-up research): **LU** (Creos transmission, ILR regulates — likely 🟢 inheritance from CE-EU bloc); **CY** (EAC vertically integrated state monopoly, EuroAsia Interconnector under construction; CERA regulates); **MT** (Enemalta + 200 MW HVDC interconnector to Sicily since 2015; MRA regulates). These three are placeholders pending dedicated research; treat as MEDIUM-LOW confidence until next refresh.

## Status

**Last refreshed**: 2026-05-09. **Next refresh**: monthly for high-volatility markets (LB · NG · GH · EC · CO · KZ · UZ · KE · IN · EG · TR · CL · MD · ME), quarterly for stable Tier-2 (most EU, AU, NZ, JP, KR, TW), per-event (any nationwide blackout / regulator decision / capacity-market reform).

**Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH for the regional patterns + reform calendar (well-sourced); MEDIUM for per-country one-liners (mix of regulator-published + extrapolated); LOW for the 3 coverage-gap microstates pending follow-up.
