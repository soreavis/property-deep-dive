# Universal `--home-tax` Section

Buyer-nationality tax overlay for foreign property. Indexed by **buyer's tax-residence country** (not the property country). Covers 20+ buyer cohorts plus 10 cross-cutting structural traps. Companion to `shared/tax.md` (property-country-side: tax fonciere/IBI/IMU/etc.) and `shared/finance.md` (mortgage availability for non-resident buyers).

**Snapshot**: 2026-05-09. Tax law moves fast — every numeric claim is statute / form / circular-cited and date-stamped. Where a parliamentary bill is mid-flight (NL Wet WRBox3 → 2028; FR PLF 2026 exit-tax extension; IT 2026 PLF 24-bis to €300k; KR 2028 Inheritance Acquisition System; US TCJA estate-exemption sunset/OBBBA permanence) the document flags MEDIUM confidence and points to the parliamentary tracker.

**Anti-hallucination**: every cluster ends with `Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` and a `Last verified` date. Every numeric claim either cites a primary statute / form / circular OR is labelled `est.` with computation shown. Forbidden phrasings per `shared/anti-hallucination.md` § Forbidden phrasings are avoided throughout.

**Disambiguation — `--home-tax` vs `--tax` vs `--finance` vs `--notary`**:
- `--home-tax` = **buyer-residence-side**. What the buyer's home tax authority does to them annually + at disposal + at death + at emigration because they own foreign property.
- `--tax` = **property-country-side**. Local property tax, transaction tax, future revaluations.
- `--finance` = mortgage availability for non-resident buyers in the property country.
- `--notary` = transaction-completion process (deed, days from offer to closing, closing costs).

Tax due in BOTH countries is the norm, with bilateral relief via DTT (credit method or exemption-with-progression). Both must be modelled.

## Universal contract

For the **buyer's tax-residence country**, return:

1. **Tax-residence trigger** — what makes a buyer a tax resident (days-test + domicile/centre-of-life test + treaty tie-breaker)
2. **Worldwide-income reach** — does the home country tax foreign rental? Form / schedule for reporting?
3. **Foreign-asset disclosure** — mandatory annual reporting (FBAR + Form 8938 / T1135 / Modelo 720 / Quadro RW / Schedule FA / Form 3916 / Anlage AUS / Form 5060 / Bens no Exterior + CBE)
4. **CGT on disposal** — rate, holding-period exemptions, treaty allocation (situs vs credit), principal-residence relief
5. **Annual wealth / property tax on overseas RE** — IFI (FR), Patrimonio + ITSGF (ES), Formueskatt (NO), Box 3 (NL), IVIE (IT), Vermögenssteuer (CH), Ejendomsværdiskat (DK)
6. **Estate / inheritance exposure** — worldwide for resident decedent/heir? Treaty network (US 16, UK ~10, DE 5, FR ~7, IT ~7, ES ~3)
7. **Departure / exit tax** — does emigration trigger a deemed disposition on foreign RE? (US/CA/AU/IL/ZA YES on direct foreign RE; DE/FR/JP/KR shareholdings only)
8. **2024-2026 reforms** — date-stamped reform calendar
9. **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

## Cross-cutting traps to surface every time

These appear across multiple buyer cohorts and warrant a flag whenever a buyer is shopping abroad. Detailed mechanism + statutory anchors are in the **Cross-cutting structural detail** section near the end.

1. **Phantom currency-gain on foreign mortgage payoff** — most-missed item for US buyers (IRC § 988 ordinary gain on FX swing of mortgage principal — separate from the property's CGT computation). Anchor case ***Quijano v. United States*** rejects netting FX loss against property gain on personal-use mortgage. Australian Div 775 Forex Realisation Event 4 + Canadian ITA § 39(2) + Japanese § 57-3 produce similar exposure. **Integrated systems (UK Bentley v Pike; DE Anlage V-Ausland; FR CGI 150 U; IT TUIR Art. 67) avoid the bifurcation.**

2. **PFIC trap on foreign collective-investment vehicles (US-only)** — IRC § 1297. Spanish SOCIMI, French SCPI, German Offene Immobilienfonds, UK REIT, Australian LIT/MIT, Singapore/HK property funds → almost always PFIC for US individual holders. Three regimes (§ 1291 default punitive / § 1295 QEF requires PFIC Annual Information Statement / § 1296 mark-to-market only for marketable PFICs). Direct ownership avoids PFIC; pooled vehicles trigger it. Foreign-property-fund ETFs sold by Charles Schwab to US clients in their UK/AU/HK arms are still PFICs.

3. **Wealth tax on overseas property — multi-country footprint** — most DTTs do NOT cover wealth tax. **FR IFI** worldwide for FR resident > €1.3M; **ES Patrimonio + ITSGF** worldwide > €700k base + ITSGF > €3M; **NO Formueskatt** worldwide > NOK 1.7M; **CH Vermögenssteuer** cantonal worldwide; **NL Box 3** deemed-return on worldwide assets; **IT IVIE** 1.06% asset-class-specific on foreign RE only; **DK Ejendomsværdiskat** uniquely applies to foreign property at Danish rates. A French resident buying a Madrid pied-à-terre is in scope for BOTH IFI (worldwide) AND ES Patrimonio (Spanish-situs) — overlap not eliminated by DTT.

4. **Estate / inheritance-tax patchwork** — bilateral estate-tax treaties are RARE. US has 16 ([IRS estate & gift treaties](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international)); UK ~10; DE 5 (DK · FR · CH · US · GR — SE 2007 / AT 2008 terminated); FR ~7; IT ~7; ES ~3; NL handful. Most foreign property held by a resident decedent gets DOUBLE-TAXED on death. State-level estate taxes (NY/MA/CT/IL/MN/OR/WA/RI/ME/VT/MD/HI/DC) layer on without treaty relief.

5. **Departure / exit-tax events** — **direct foreign real estate is in exit-tax scope in US (§ 877A) / CA (ITA § 128.1) / AU (CGT event I1) / IL (§ 100A) / ZA (§ 9H)** and **OUT of scope in DE (§ 6 AStG only on shareholdings ≥ 1%) / FR (Art. 167 bis only on shareholdings > €800k or > 50%) / JP (§ 60-2 securities > ¥100M) / KR (Art. 118-9 securities > ₩500M)**. Verify before structuring exit. Holding foreign rental via a German GmbH brings DE § 6 AStG into scope on emigration even though direct property would not.

6. **Special-inbound-regime lock-in** — IT 24-bis (€100k or €200k flat on foreign income, 15-year cap) / IT 24-ter (7% pensioners' Mezzogiorno, 9-year cap) / ES Beckham (24% flat 6 years) / UK FIG (4-year exemption post-non-dom abolition) / IL Olim (10-year foreign-income exemption + 2026 reporting reform) / NL 30%-ruling (→ 27% from 2027). Each has tight grandfathering windows and entry conditions; missing the window or breaking residency continuity loses the regime irrecoverably.

7. **Treaty FTC vs treaty exemption — DTT cascade** — real-property income is allocated to *situs* country under OECD MTC Art. 6 but BOTH countries can typically tax (Art. 24 Methods). **Exemption-with-progression** (DE / AT / FR / CH for most EU treaties) → foreign income free but pushes domestic into higher band. **Credit method** (US / UK / CA / AU / JP / IN) → fully taxable with foreign-tax credit capped at home tax on that income. Excess credit carries forward 10y in US; 1-year carryback / 10-year carryforward; lost immediately in AU and NZ (no carryforward). The German Anrechnungsmethode applied to ES rental (DE-ES DTT 2013) is a CREDIT regime — atypical for DE. Verify each treaty's Article 24 method case-by-case.

## Buyer cohort: United States — citizenship-based (IRC + IRS)

US tax residence is uniquely **citizenship-based** — a US citizen owes US tax on worldwide income regardless of where they live or whether they ever set foot in the US. Three triggers: US citizen (forever, until § 877A renunciation); lawful permanent resident under IRC § 7701(b)(1)(A)(i) until I-407 surrender or treaty tie-breaker; substantial presence test (≥ 31 d current + ≥ 183 weighted d over 3 y). Treaty tie-breaker (Form 8833) changes computation, NOT filing — FBAR + Form 8938 + Form 8621 + Form 3520 all still apply.

### Worldwide-income reach — IRC § 61, § 469, § 168(g)
- Schedule E for foreign rental income/expenses, **USD with annual averaging** (Rev. Rul. 89-78). § 988 functional-currency election available for QBU (rare for individuals).
- Net rental loss limitation under § 469 passive activity rules; suspended until passive income or disposition; active-participation $25k allowance phases out $100k–$150k AGI.
- Depreciation: IRC § 168(g)(1)(A) **mandates ADS for tangible property used predominantly outside the US**. Residential rental → **30-year ADS** post-TCJA (was 40, now 30 per § 168(g)(2)(C)(iii) effective post-2017). Bonus depreciation under § 168(k) **does not apply** to ADS property — OBBBA's restored 100% bonus is moot for foreign property.
- Mortgage interest § 163(h) deductible on foreign principal/second residence subject to $750k acquisition-debt cap (post-TCJA; $1M for pre-15-Dec-2017 debt).

### FATCA Form 8938 — IRC § 6038D
Filing thresholds (verified 2025 IRS instructions):

| Filer | EOY threshold | Anytime threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Single / MFS, US-based | $50,000 | $75,000 |
| MFJ, US-based | $100,000 | $150,000 |
| Single / MFS, abroad | $200,000 | $300,000 |
| MFJ, abroad | $400,000 | $600,000 |

Real estate **held DIRECTLY** is NOT a "specified foreign financial asset" — but **interest in a foreign corporation/partnership/trust holding the RE** IS. Common traps: French SCI, German GmbH, Spanish SL, UK Ltd, BVI/Cayman holding company. Foreign bank accounts opened to service the property (notary escrow, deposit account for utilities/HOA, currency-conversion account) ARE SFFAs. Penalties under IRC § 6038D(d) / § 6662(j): $10k initial + $10k per 30-day continuation up to $50k additional + 40% accuracy-related on understatement attributable to undisclosed asset.

### FBAR / FinCEN 114 — Title 31 § 5314 + 31 CFR § 1010.350
Filed with FinCEN (NOT Title 26). Aggregate > **$10,000** at any moment in calendar year on foreign financial accounts. **Signature authority counts.** Notary escrow, foreign mortgage offset account, deposit account for rental income, currency-broker account (Wise/Revolut multi-currency wallets reportable per FinCEN), utility-direct-debit account → all reportable. Real estate held directly is NOT reportable (not a financial account). Penalties (31 CFR 1010.821, 2025): non-willful up to $16,536 per violation; willful greater of $165,353 or 50% of account balance. **Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. (28 Feb 2023)** — non-willful penalty **per FBAR form, not per account** (5–4 Gorsuch). [SCOTUS opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1195_h3ci.pdf).

### PFIC — IRC § 1297, § 1291/1295/1296, Form 8621
Foreign corp is PFIC if 75%+ gross passive income OR 50%+ assets produce passive income. Most pooled foreign property vehicles ARE PFICs:

| Vehicle | Country | PFIC status |
|---|---|---|
| SOCIMI | ES | YES — practitioner consensus |
| SCPI | FR | YES — practitioner consensus |
| Offene Immobilienfonds | DE | YES — practitioner consensus |
| REIT (UK / SG / HK) | various | YES for individual US holders |
| LIT / MIT (property trust) | AU | YES if elected corporate status |
| Direct title in own name | any | NO — not a corporation |

§ 1291 default = punitive (ordinary-rate tax + interest charge on excess distributions back to acquisition). § 1295 QEF requires PFIC Annual Information Statement (most foreign funds don't issue). § 1296 mark-to-market only for "marketable" PFICs (publicly listed).

### § 988 functional-currency phantom-gain — the Vinaigrette / Quijano trap
IRC § 988(a)(1) treats foreign-currency gain/loss on § 988 transactions as **ordinary income** (not capital). § 988(c)(1)(B)(iii) defines a debt instrument denominated in non-functional currency as a § 988 transaction. Functional currency for an individual = USD (§ 985(b)(1)(A)).

**Mechanism**: paying off a foreign-currency mortgage when USD has strengthened = ordinary § 988 gain on the FX swing of principal, taxed at marginal up to 37%. Separate from § 121 / capital-gain on the property itself. Refinancing (closing old, opening new) is a triggering event.

**§ 988(e) personal-transaction rule**: gain ≤ $200 per transaction excluded; if gain > $200, ALL of it is taxable (cliff). Gains taxable, losses non-deductible (§ 165(c) personal-loss limitation) — one-way asymmetry. Anchor case ***Quijano v. United States*** (US Tax Court — UK couple selling UK home; IRS denied integration of FX loss with property gain; § 988(d)(1) hedging-transaction argument rejected because mortgage wasn't trade-or-business). The "Vinaigrette" colloquial name lacks a citable opinion — use *Quijano* as authority.

### Sale of foreign principal residence — IRC § 121
$250k single / $500k MFJ exclusion applies **worldwide**. Ownership AND use as principal residence ≥ 2 of prior 5 years. § 988 mortgage gain is computed separately and is **NOT** excluded by § 121.

### Sale of foreign rental — § 1031 + § 1250 + § 1411
LTCG > 12 months at 0/15/20% federal + 3.8% NIIT. **§ 1031(h)(1) explicitly: foreign-to-US 1031 prohibited; foreign-to-foreign permitted.** § 1250 unrecaptured depreciation taxed at max 25% federal on gain attributable to ADS depreciation taken. NIIT 3.8% on net investment income > $200k single / $250k MFJ.

### Foreign Tax Credit — IRC § 901, § 904, Form 1116
Separate baskets under § 904(d): passive (rental), general, foreign branch, GILTI, treaty-resourced. Direct FTC usually preferred over § 911 FEIE (FEIE covers earned income only). § 904 cap: credit can't exceed US tax allocable to foreign-source income; excess: 1y carryback + 10y carryforward. Capital-gain rate-differential trap (§ 904(b)(2)(B)) — if foreign gain taxed at preferential US LTCG rate, FTC scaled down proportionally. HTKO ("high-tax kick-out") election kicks passive income taxed > 37% by foreign country into general basket.

### Federal estate tax + treaty patchwork
**OBBBA reform 4 Jul 2025** — TCJA doubled exemption made permanent at **$15M per individual** ($30M MFJ) effective 1 Jan 2026, indexed from 2025 base. TCJA-sunset-to-$7M scenario no longer operative. ([Arnold & Porter advisory](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2025/07/increases-to-the-federal-estate-and-gift-tax-exemption-under-the-obbba)) Worldwide gross estate (IRC § 2031, § 2033). Top rate 40% on excess (§ 2001(c)).

**Estate-tax treaty list — 16 verified countries** ([IRS page](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international)): AU · AT · CA (via Income Treaty Art XXIX B) · DK · FI · FR · DE · GR · IE · IT · JP · NL · NO · ZA · SE · CH · UK. (NO terminated 2015, SE terminated 2007 — verify; older lists may include them.) Without treaty: worldwide US estate + foreign-country situs = double-tax with limited § 2014 FTC mitigation. State-level estate/inheritance taxes (MA/OR/WA/RI/ME/VT/MN/IL/MD/HI/NY/DC + CT raised to fed level 2024; MD + NJ separate inheritance) layer without treaty relief.

### § 877A expatriation tax
Triggered by: renunciation (CLN issued); long-term green-card (8 of 15 years) abandonment under I-407 or treaty tie-breaker. Covered expatriate = net worth ≥ $2M OR 5-year average net income tax > $211k (2026 per Rev. Proc. 2025-32; $206k 2025) OR failure to certify 5-year compliance on Form 8854. Mark-to-market deemed sale of all property at FMV day before expatriation. § 877A(a)(3) exclusion: $890k (2025) / $910k (2026). Deferral election § 877A(b) with security + treaty filing.

### Foreign trust + foreign corporation
Foreign-grantor-trust IRC § 671-679. § 679 deems any US transferor to a foreign trust with US beneficiary the grantor (100% income attribution) for 5 years post-transfer. Form 3520 annual return for transactions with foreign trust + foreign gift > $100k/year individual or > $19,570 (2026) corp. Form 3520-A annual info return; trustee files; if won't, US owner files substitute by 15 Mar. **IRS Oct 2024 announcement** — automatic penalties on late 3520/3520-A no longer assessed for foreign-gift filings; reasonable-cause review standard. Form 5471 (≥10% US person ownership of foreign corp); Form 8865 (foreign partnership). GILTI § 951A — if foreign rental held in CFC, GILTI sweeps tested income annually; § 962 election allows individual taxation at corporate rate + FTC; § 954(b)(4) high-tax exclusion where foreign effective rate > 18.9%.

### State-level overlay
- **California** — § 17041 worldwide; FTB 1031 sticky domicile rules.
- **New York** — IT-201 worldwide; statutory residence test (183 d + permanent place of abode); NY estate tax $7.16M exemption 2025 with 105% cliff.
- **9 no-income-tax states** — FL, TX, WA, NV, SD, WY, AK, TN, NH (NH I&D sunsets 1 Jan 2027). Cleanest exposure for foreign-property-owning US persons.

### 2024-2026 reforms

| Date | Reform |
|---|---|
| 2025-07-04 | OBBBA — estate exemption permanent $15M (2026 base, indexed) |
| 2024-10 | IRS ends automatic penalties on late 3520/3520-A foreign-gift filings |
| 2024-05 | Treasury proposed regs on foreign-trust transactions (89 Fed Reg 39440) |
| 2023-02-28 | Bittner v. US — non-willful FBAR per form, not per account |
| 2024 (CT) | CT estate-tax exemption raised to federal level |
| 2027-01-01 | NH I&D sunsets |

**Confidence: HIGH** for cited statute + IRS guidance; **MEDIUM** for vehicle-specific PFIC classifications + § 988 personal-use treatment (no Treasury reg or Tax Court case carving out personal-residence mortgage from § 988 — practitioner consensus only).
**Last verified**: 2026-05-09.

## Buyer cohort: United Kingdom — FA 2025 FIG + LTR (post-non-dom abolition)

The UK is mid-2026 transition through the BIGGEST overhaul of overseas-asset taxation in 40+ years: **non-dom regime abolished 6 Apr 2025**; replaced by 4-year FIG regime; **IHT shifted from domicile-based to residence-based 6 Apr 2025**. Non-doms previously claiming remittance basis are now potentially exposed to UK tax on global rental from 6 Apr 2025.

### UK Statutory Residence Test (SRT) — Sch 45 FA 2013
Apply in sequence; first decisive answer wins:

1. **Automatic overseas tests** (Sch 45 §§ 12-16): < 16 d if resident in any of 3 prior years; < 46 d if not resident in any of 3 prior; full-time work overseas (≥ 35 hrs/wk avg) AND < 91 UK days AND < 31 UK workdays.
2. **Automatic UK tests** (§§ 6-9): ≥ 183 d in tax year; only home in UK for ≥ 91 d (used ≥ 30); full-time work in UK over 365-day period.
3. **Sufficient ties test** (§§ 17-20): 4 ties for leavers (family, accommodation, work, 90-day prior, country tie); 4 for arrivers (no country tie). Day-count vs ties matrix in RDR3 § 3.4-3.5.
4. **Split-year treatment** (Pt 3 §§ 43-55): 8 cases (1-3 leavers, 4-8 arrivers).

Case-law trap: ***A Taxpayer v HMRC* [2025] EWCA Civ 106** — Court of Appeal restored FTT's exceptional-circumstances exclusion (Sch 45 § 22(4)) for sister's grave illness. Burden of proof is day-by-day on the taxpayer.

### FIG regime — FA 2025 Sch 9 (effective 6 Apr 2025)
Domicile is **gone** for income tax + CGT. Replaced by:
- **4-year FIG** for "qualifying new residents": UK resident after ≥ 10 consecutive non-UK-resident tax years → first 4 years' foreign income & gains exempt UK tax. Claim by 31 Jan in Y+2 via SA return.
- Cost: lose Personal Allowance and CGT Annual Exempt Amount that year.
- After year 4: full UK tax on global income + CGT — no residual remittance shelter.
- **Temporary Repatriation Facility (TRF)** transitional — 12% (yrs 1-2) / 15% (yr 3) flat charge to remit pre-2025 unremitted income/gains.

[RFIG41000 introduction](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/residence-and-fig-regime-manual/rfig41000) · [GOV.UK FIG regime claim guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-claim-the-4-year-foreign-income-and-gains-regime). HMRC manual still being populated; consultation responses still emerging.

### Foreign rental — overseas property business
ITTOIA 2005 §§ 264-265 (overseas property business chargeable only if carried on by UK resident). Computed using UK-property-business rules; profits **pooled separately** — overseas losses cannot offset UK pool, only future overseas profits. Reported on **SA106 Foreign Pages**, in £-sterling.

**Mortgage/finance-cost restriction** ITTOIA 2005 §§ 272A-B (FA No. 2 2015 § 24, fully phased in 6 Apr 2020): no deduction from rental for residential finance costs; replaced by 20% basic-rate tax reducer capped at lower of finance costs / property profits / total income above PA. **Applies equally to UK and overseas property** (§ 272A(7)).

**FTCR** under ITA 2007 §§ 793-806 / TIOPA 2010 Pt 2: credit foreign tax paid against UK income tax on same income, capped at UK tax payable. Excess foreign tax is unclaimable. Helpsheet HS263.

**FHL abolished 6 Apr 2025** (FA 2024-25): Furnished Holiday Letting regime for UK *and* EEA properties gone — full mortgage-interest deduction, capital allowances on new spend, BADR on disposal, pension-relevant earnings status all removed. Transitional (HMRC Nov 2024 guidance): existing capital allowances pool continues WDA; carried-forward FHL losses transferable to ordinary UK or overseas property pool; BADR claimable on cessation up to 3 yrs before 6 Apr 2025; anti-forestalling for unconditional contracts 6 Mar 2024 - 5 Apr 2025.

### CGT on foreign property disposal — TCGA 1992 § 1
Residential, individuals, post-30 Oct 2024 Budget cut: basic rate 18%, **higher/additional 24%** (cut from 28%). Annual exempt amount £3,000 (2025-26) — slashed from £12,300 (2022-23). PPR relief § 222-223; § 222(5) nomination required where > 1 residence (**2 years** from new combination — Griffin v Craig-Harvey); § 223 final-period relief 9 months. § 222B/§ 222C overseas residence eligible only if not a "non-qualifying tax year". § 222(5A) saves late nominations only where taxpayer didn't realise they had two PPRs.

### Forex in CGT — Bentley v Pike controlling
***Bentley v Pike*** [1981] STC 360 — **sterling is the only permissible unit of account**; foreign-currency cost translated at acquisition-date rate, proceeds at disposal-date rate. No US § 988-style bifurcation; currency movement is part of chargeable gain. HMRC manual [CG78310 foreign currency](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg78310). Foreign mortgage repayment: any £ "saving" on weak-£ acquisition followed by strong-£ disposal increases the £ gain even if foreign-currency P&L is flat. Operational consequence: refinance during weak £ period locks in higher base cost (helpful); dispose during strong £ period accelerates gain (painful).

### IHT — residence-based from 6 Apr 2025
**Pre-6 Apr 2025**: domicile-based — UK-doms taxed worldwide; non-doms taxed UK-situs only. Deemed-dom 15/20.

**Post-6 Apr 2025 — Long-Term Resident (LTR) test** — IHTA 1984 § 6A ff. (FA 2025 Sch 13):
- Trigger: UK resident **≥ 10 of prior 20 tax years** ending year before chargeable event → worldwide IHT.
- Tail on leaving: 3 years (10-13 yrs LTR) increasing 1 year per additional year of residence, **capped at 10 years** (20+ yrs UK residence → 10-yr tail).
- Reset: 10 consecutive non-UK-resident years break LTR.
- Transitional (IHTM47021): individuals non-resident 2025-26 AND not UK-domiciled 30 Oct 2024 stay on old domicile test for pre-6-Apr-2025 events.

Rates: 40% over £325k nil-rate band; £175k residence nil-rate band (qualifying residential interest to direct descendants; tapered for estates > £2M). Both bands frozen until at least 5 Apr 2030 (Autumn 2024 Budget).

**IHT treaties** (~10 partners): FR (1963 Estate Duty Convention), IT (1968), NL, IE (1978), IN, PK, ZA, CH, SE, US. **Pre-1975 treaties (FR, IT, IN, PK)** lack deemed-domicile articles → may **override** the new LTR rule for treaty residents. Outside treaty: unilateral relief IHTA 1984 § 159 credits foreign death tax against UK IHT on same asset.

[IHTM47020 long-term UK residence](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm47020) · [IHTM47021 transitional](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm47021).

### Reporting cadence

| Obligation | Form | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Foreign rental | SA100 + SA106 | 31 Jan following year-end |
| CGT on **UK** residential | UK Property CGT return + payment | **60 days** of completion |
| CGT on **overseas** residential | SA108 with annual return | 31 Jan following year-end |
| FIG regime claim | SA return | 31 Jan in Y+2 |
| Voluntary catch-up | Worldwide Disclosure Facility | 90 days post-DRN |

Important: 60-day reporting applies to **UK residential disposals only**. Foreign residential disposals by UK residents go on the next SA return. ([ATT guide](https://www.att.org.uk/cgt-uk-property-reporting-service-users-guide))

No US-style FBAR / 8938 / 720 equivalent — but **CRS** delivers HMRC automatic data from 100+ jurisdictions; from Jan 2024 Airbnb / Booking.com submitted UK host data via DAC7-equivalent rules. HMRC nudge-letter campaigns 2017-onward (foreign income, offshore structures, from 2024 specifically overseas-property rentals).

## Buyer cohort: Canada — CRA + Income Tax Act (RSC 1985 c.1 5th Supp.)

### Tax residence
Common-law factual + ITA § 250(1)(a) deemed (sojourn ≥ 183 d). Folio S5-F1-C1 governs residential-ties test: primary (dwelling, spouse, dependants) + secondary (DL, healthcare, club, professional, banking). Treaty tie-breaker (OECD Art. 4) overrides domestic deeming.

### Foreign rental — Form T776, BoC FX
Income/expenses converted to CAD using **BoC daily rates** (or annual average for high-volume — T1 General Guide). **CCA optional + restricted by Reg § 1100(11)**: cannot create or increase a rental loss — only reduce net to nil. Rule applies identically to foreign and Canadian rentals. **FTC** under ITA § 126(1) → Form **T2209**; per-country and capped at Canadian tax on that source.

### T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement
Mandatory if total cost amount of specified foreign property > **CAD 100,000** at any time in year (ITA § 233.3). **Personal-use real estate is excluded** — vacation home > 50% personal NOT specified property. **Rented foreign property IS specified property** even below CAD 100k individually (counts toward threshold). Mixed-use AirBnB grey zone — CRA's "primarily" (> 50%) test fact-specific. Simplified Method (Part A) CAD 100k–250k; Detailed Method (Part B) > CAD 250k. Penalty: $25/day max $2,500/yr (§ 162(7)); $500/mo or $1,000/mo gross-negligence (§ 162(10)); $12,000/$24,000 false-statement caps; 3-yr extended reassessment (§ 152(4)(b.2)). VDP IC00-1R6 for catch-up.

### Disposal — 50% inclusion (66.67% proposal cancelled)
50% inclusion **remains in force**. Budget-2024 proposal to raise to 66.67% on individual gains > CAD 250k (effective 25 Jun 2024) was **deferred 31 Jan 2025 to 1 Jan 2026 then formally cancelled by PM Carney 21 Mar 2025** (Liberals). All gains continue under 50% rate.

**Principal Residence Exemption** § 40(2)(b) + § 54 — overseas property eligible if qualifies as PR for the year (CRA Folio S1-F3-C2 ¶ 2.11–2.13: ordinarily inhabited rule liberal — even short annual occupation can satisfy). One-PR-per-family-unit-per-year (§ 54(c.1)) post-1981 — choose strategically year-by-year. T2091(IND) designation form mandatory for all PR dispositions for 2016+ tax years (CRA news release 03 Oct 2016). 2017 amendment: trusts can no longer designate PR unless tightly defined.

### Departure tax — § 128.1(4) deemed disposition, foreign RE INCLUDED
On ceasing CA residence, all property deemed disposed at FMV — except § 128.1(4)(b)(i)–(iv) carve-outs: Canadian RE, Canadian resource property, Canadian business property of PE, RPP/RRSP/TFSA, employee stock options. **Foreign RE NOT carved out — fully exposed.** Form T1243 computes gain; T1244 elects deferral under § 220(4.5). Security required if federal tax owing > CAD 16,500 (CAD 13,777.50 for ex-Quebec). Practitioner trap: CA-RE excluded from departure tax but post-emigration disposal triggers § 116 25% non-resident withholding; foreign RE does the opposite — taxed on the way out.

### Estate — no estate tax, but § 70(5) deemed disposition
On death, § 70(5) deems disposition at FMV → terminal CGT (50% inclusion). Spousal/CLP rollover § 70(6). Probate fees provincial: ON 1.5%, BC 1.4%, AB flat, QC notarial wills exempt.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- 23 Jun 2024: CGT inclusion-rate hike 66.67% **CANCELLED 21 Mar 2025**.
- UHT: Bill C-15 (tabled 18 Nov 2025) proposes elimination 2025+. Most CA-resident individuals "excluded owners" since 2023.
- Bare-trust reporting (§ 150(1.1)) — pulled in 31 Dec 2023 via Bill C-32; CRA suspended for 2023, re-introduced for 2024 with carve-outs.

**Confidence: HIGH** (current law); **MEDIUM** on UHT elimination Royal Assent timing.

## Buyer cohort: Australia — ATO + ITAA 1936/1997

### Tax residence — 4 tests under ITAA 1936 § 6(1)
Resides test (common-law, primary), Domicile test, 183-day test, Cwlth super-fund test. ATO ruling **TR 2023/1** (finalised Jun 2023) replaces TR 98/17. **2021 Budget proposed bright-line 183-day primary + factor secondary** — Treasury consultation closed Sep 2023; **as of May 2026 NOT enacted**, no draft bill, increasingly treated as shelved.

### Worldwide income — § 6-5(2) ITAA 1997
FX translation Subdiv 960-C ITAA 1997 + functional-currency § 960-50: rental items translated at daily rate or yearly average (PCG 2017/4).

### Foreign rental — negative gearing into AU income
**Foreign-loss quarantining REPEALED 1 Jul 2008** (Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007 Sch 1). Foreign rental losses can offset Australian salary, business, investment income — same negative-gearing as domestic. Deductible: interest, Div 40 depreciation (§ 40-27 prohibits depreciation on second-hand depreciating assets in residential rental post-9 May 2017 Budget — applies to foreign too), capital works Div 43 (2.5% × 40 yrs). **FITO** Div 770 — capped at AU tax on that income; AUD 1,000 de minimis; **no carry-forward**.

### CGT — Div 855 ITAA 1997
Australian residents subject to CGT on worldwide assets. CGT event A1 (§ 104-10) on disposal. **50% individual discount** § 115-25 for assets held > 12 months. Cost base in AUD (§ 960-50 daily-rate at incurrence). **Main Residence Exemption** § 118-110 extends to overseas dwelling — BUT **MRE for foreign residents REMOVED post-30 Jun 2020** (Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability) Act 2019, RA 12 Dec 2019). Life-events test exception: foreign residency ≤ 6 continuous years AND qualifying life event.

**FRCGW** — threshold removed and rate raised to **15% from 1 Jan 2025** (TLA Bill, RA 10 Dec 2024). Applies to Australian RE only when expat sells. Threshold was AUD 750k @ 12.5% pre-change. Important ordering trap: this affects Aussies returning to sell their AU home while non-resident, NOT foreign-property sales by AU residents.

### CFC / FIF — Part X ITAA 1936
Direct ownership of foreign residential RE NOT a CFC interest. CFC attribution where AU resident has ≥ 10% interest in foreign company with ≥ 40% control. Property-holding foreign companies (FR SCI, ES SL) **can** trigger CFC if AU owner controls. French SCI is transparent under FR domestic law but ATO will treat as company unless partnership election applies — verify with private ruling.

### Disclosure
No T1135-equivalent. Foreign income at **Item 20 (Supplementary)** — labels for foreign rental, foreign pensions, FITO, controlled-entity attributable income. CRS active 2017+. ATO 2024-25 Budget AUD 187m additional for Tax Avoidance Taskforce.

### Estate — no death duties; CGT event K3
Estate/inheritance taxes abolished 1979. § 104-215 CGT event K3 deems disposal at FMV when asset passes to foreign-resident or tax-exempt beneficiary. Passing to AU-resident beneficiary uses § 128-15 rollover. Deceased's main residence has 2-yr post-death sale window.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- 1 Jan 2025: FRCGW 12.5% → 15%, threshold AUD 750k → 0 (AU RE only).
- 1 Jul 2024: Stage 3 personal-tax cuts.
- 2024-25 Budget: ATO Tax Avoidance Taskforce funding increased.
- 2021 residency reform: NOT enacted.

**Confidence: HIGH** (current law; reform stalled).

## Buyer cohort: New Zealand — IRD + Income Tax Act 2007

### Tax residence — § YD 1
Permanent place of abode (PPOA) test primary, fact-based, ties-driven. 183-day backstop in any 12-mo period (§ YD 1(3)). **Transitional resident relief § HR 8** — new arrivers (incl. returning Kiwis after ≥ 10 yr non-resident) get a 4-year exemption on most foreign passive income (incl. foreign rental); does NOT cover NZ-source or employment income.

### Foreign rental — IR3R, ring-fenced losses
Reported on **IR3R schedule** + IR3 individual return. NZD conversion at IRD-published mid-month rates. **Ring-fenced rental losses § EL 4-EL 12** (Taxation (Annual Rates 2019-20, GST and Information Sharing) Act 2019, RA 26 Jun 2019, retrospective 2019/20): **applies to overseas residential rentals**. Losses cannot offset salary/wages/business income — carry forward against future residential property income only. **Interest deductibility for residential rentals fully restored 1 Apr 2025** (100%; phased: 80% 2024-25, 100% 2025-26). FTC § LJ 1 capped at NZ tax; per-country segregation; excess generally lost (no carry-forward).

### FIF — § EX 28 ff. — the surprise on foreign property holding entities
**Direct ownership of foreign RE is NOT a FIF interest** (§ EX 31, § EX 35 — interest in foreign company is FIF; bare RE is not). **BUT**: ownership through foreign company / unit trust / superannuation / LP-treated-as-company **IS** a FIF. French SCIs, Spanish SLs, US LLCs, German GmbHs holding the property → FIF.

**NZD 50,000 threshold (§ CQ 5(1)(d))** — total cost of all FIF interests (individuals only — NOT trusts or companies). Below: exempt from FIF, only actual dividends/distributions taxable. Above: FIF income computed under FDR (Fair Dividend Rate) 5% deemed annually × opening market value, Cost Method, Comparative Value, Attributable FIF, or Branch Equivalent. FDR most common.

Trap: NZ owner of FR SCI / ES SL holding a single property thinks "just a holding entity, ignore it" — actually FIF, deemed 5% income annually regardless of cash flow, plus rental income separately. Many foreign legal forms force entity ownership for civil-law reasons (succession, asset protection) — NZ tax tail can wag the structuring dog.

### Bright-line property test — § CB 6A — FOREIGN PROPERTY OUTSIDE SCOPE
NZ-located residential land: **2-year bright-line** for disposals on/after 1 Jul 2024 (Restoring Tax Deductibility for Residential Investment Property Bill, RA Jun 2024). Pre-1 Jul 2024 follow 5-/10-year tests under prior National-Labour see-saw. **Bright-line does NOT apply to foreign-located residential land.** Foreign-property disposal gains taxed only under intent-of-resale § CB 6, business of dealing § CB 7, or business of erecting buildings § CB 12. NZ has **no general CGT** — regime is intent-based plus bright-line proxy.

### Estate — no inheritance/estate tax
Estate Duty abolished 1992; Gift Duty abolished 1 Oct 2011. No deemed disposition on death. Foreign-jurisdiction estate tax may bite (FR 60% non-spouse non-direct, ES regional, etc.) — tax-treaty estate articles relevant.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- 1 Jul 2024: bright-line back to 2 years (NZ-located).
- 1 Apr 2024: tax-bracket adjustments (10.5% to NZD 15,600; 17.5% to 53,500; 30% to 78,100; 33% to 180,000; 39% above) — first since 2010.
- 1 Apr 2025: residential interest deductibility 100% restored.
- Foreign-buyer ban (Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018) still in force (NZ-purchase by non-residents prohibited; not relevant for NZ buyer abroad).

**Confidence: HIGH**.

## Buyer cohort: Germany — EStG · AStG · ErbStG · AO

### Tax residence — § 8 / § 9 AO + § 1 EStG
Wohnsitz (§ 8 AO — dwelling kept for use) OR gewöhnlicher Aufenthalt (§ 9 AO — > 6 months presence) → **unbeschränkt steuerpflichtig** with worldwide income (§ 1 EStG). DTT tie-breaker (centre of vital interests, then habitual abode, nationality) governs dual-residence cases. (gesetze-im-internet.de/ao, /estg)

### Foreign rental — §§ 21 + 34d EStG (Anlage V + Anlage AUS)
- **EU/EEA property (FR/IT/PT/AT/NL/BE/etc.)**: most DTTs apply **Freistellung mit Progressionsvorbehalt** (treaty-exempt, but progression effect on bracket via § 32b EStG) — declared in Anlage AUS for progression only.
- **Spain — exception**: DE-ES DTT (in force since 2013) uses the **Anrechnungsmethode** (credit) for rental income; report in Anlage V + Anlage AUS, deduct Spanish IRPF up to German cap.
- **Non-EU/EEA**: § 2a Abs. 1 Nr. 6 EStG — foreign rental losses only offset same-country same-source positive income (Drittstaaten-Verlustabzugsbeschränkung); no § 10d carry-back.
- **AfA**: § 7 (4) — 2% straight-line; 3% for buildings completed post-2023 (Wachstumschancengesetz). § 7 (5a) — degressive 5% over 6 years for residential buildings with construction start 1 Oct 2023 – 30 Sep 2029 (rate cut from originally proposed 6% during Vermittlungsausschuss; signed Mar 2024).

### Disposal — § 23 EStG
- **Spekulationsfrist 10 years** for real estate (held privately, including foreign): outside → tax-free; within → ordinary marginal rate.
- BFH confirmed: Germany retains taxation right on gain by an unbeschränkt resident regardless of property situs, subject to DTT. Most DTTs (FR/IT/ES/AT/NL) allocate to situs country with **Freistellung** + progression in Germany.
- Trap: if property was rented during ownership, full 10y window applies. Self-use 3y prior to sale (last year + two preceding) restores § 23 exemption.

### Wegzugsbesteuerung — § 6 AStG
- Direct foreign real estate **NOT in scope** — only > 1% shareholdings in corporations.
- **Reform 1 Jan 2022 (ATAD-Umsetzungsgesetz)**: unlimited interest-free EU/EEA deferral abolished; replaced by 7-year installment plan (interest-free, but security required); residence-pre-departure threshold cut from 10 → 7 years.
- **17 Aug 2023** retroactive tightening of permanent-deferral conditions for pre-2022 emigrants.
- Trap: holding foreign rental via a German GmbH that holds the foreign real estate → emigration of the > 1% shareholder triggers § 6 AStG.

### Inheritance — ErbStG
- Worldwide if decedent OR heir is German-resident (§ 2 (1) Nr. 1 ErbStG).
- **§ 21 ErbStG**: foreign IHT credit, capped at German IHT on the same foreign asset.
- DTT estate-tax network (only **5** in force): **DK · FR · CH · US · GR** (the SE treaty was terminated 2007; the AT treaty was terminated effective 2008) — without DTT only § 21 unilateral credit.
- Allowances: spouse €500k · child €400k · grandchild €200k · sibling/unrelated €20k. Rates 7-50% by class.

### Wealth tax — abolished
Vermögensteuer suspended since 1997 (BVerfG 22 Jun 1995 ruling on unequal valuation). No annual return.

### Reporting — § 138 AO
- Acquisition of foreign **business** / permanent establishment / participation ≥ 10% (or > €150k cumulative cost in foreign corporation) → notifiable to BZSt + local FA via official interface, with the next income-tax return (latest 14 months after period-end). Penalty up to **€25k** (§ 379 AO).
- **Direct foreign rental real estate is NOT § 138 AO reportable** — but rental income must be in the annual return (Anlage V + Anlage AUS).
- No Italian-style Quadro RW or Spanish Modelo 720 equivalent.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- Wachstumschancengesetz Mar 2024: § 7 (5a) degressive AfA 5% × 6y for residential, plus § 7 (4) bump 2 → 3% for post-2022 completions.
- Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz (Pillar Two) 1 Jan 2024 — MNE > €750M only; not retail buyers.
- § 6 AStG amendments still bedding down post-ECJ scrutiny (C-355/22 line of cases).

## Buyer cohort: France — CGI · DGFiP

### Tax residence — Art. 4 B CGI
Resident if ANY of: foyer / lieu de séjour principal in France · main professional activity · centre des intérêts économiques. Treaty tie-breaker overlays. (legifrance.gouv.fr)

### Foreign rental — formulaires 2047 + 2042 (+ 2044 unfurnished, + 2042-C-PRO furnished)
- **Unfurnished foreign rental** → revenus fonciers (form 2044) + 2047 + 2042.
- **Furnished foreign rental** → BIC under LMNP / LMP (form 2042-C-PRO + 2031).
- Most EU DTTs: **exonération avec taux effectif** (foreign rental exempt in France but counted to set the marginal rate on French-source income — exact French analogue of the German Progressionsvorbehalt).
- DTT credit method applies for some non-EU treaties (US, etc.).

### CGT on disposal — Art. 244 bis A + 150 U CGI
- Plus-values immobilières: abatement schedule that yields full IR exemption at **22 years** of holding and full social-charges exemption at **30 years**.
  - Income tax: 6%/y from year 6-21, then 4% in year 22 → 0% IR.
  - Prélèvements sociaux: 1.65%/y from year 6-21, 1.6% in year 22, 9%/y from year 23-30.
- Most EU DTTs (DE/IT/ES/etc.) allocate situs taxation to property country; France typically applies the credit method or treaty-exempts. France retains taxation right where DTT says "may be taxed" — verify per treaty.

### IFI — Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière (Art. 964-973 CGI)
- Worldwide real estate at FMV; resident threshold **€1.3M net taxable** (tax computed from €800k); rates 0.5% → 1.5% in 6 brackets.
- **Résidence principale 30% abatement** (Art. 973 I CGI) — only owner-occupied direct ownership, not via SCI. One property only per foyer fiscal.
- Mortgage/acquisition debt deductible against the property; LF 2024 (Art. 973 IV CGI) tightened deductibility of holding-company debt — shareholder current-account advances only deductible if used to acquire/build/refinance taxable real estate.
- DTT estate/wealth treaties limit IFI relief — only ~3 still cover wealth.

### Exit tax — Art. 167 bis CGI
- Triggered on unrealised gains on shareholdings > €800k OR > 50% in companies, on losing French residence.
- **Direct real estate NOT in scope**.
- Current regime (post-2019 reform): tax extinguishes at year 2 (small holdings) or year 5 (≥ €2.57M); much narrower than pre-2018 15-year version.
- **PLF 2026 (under parliamentary navette as of Nov 2025)**: National Assembly amendment to **restore 15-year holding period** — verify final adoption before relying on the current short window.

### Inheritance — Art. 750 ter CGI
- Worldwide for French-resident decedent OR French-resident heir (post-1998: 6+ years out of 10 prior).
- Spouse and PACS partners: **exonérés** (Loi TEPA 22 Aug 2007). Children: €100k allowance, then 5-45%. Siblings: €15,932 + 35-45%. Unrelated: €1,594 + 60% flat.
- Foreign IHT credit: Art. 784 A CGI (limited to French IHT on same foreign asset).

### Reporting
- **Form 3916 / 3916-bis**: declaration of every foreign account / brokerage / crypto-platform / life-insurance contract held by a French resident. **€1,500 penalty per undeclared account/year**, raised to **€10,000** if account is in a non-cooperative state. Statute of limitations 10y when undeclared (vs. 3y normally).
- **Form 2074-IMM** for foreign property capital gain.
- **§ 1649 AA CGI**: foreign life-insurance contract disclosure.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- LF 2024 (Dec 2023): IFI valuation tightening — shareholder current-account debt restrictions (Art. 973 IV CGI).
- Pillar Two transposition 1 Jan 2024.

### IVIE — Foreign Real Estate Tax (DL 201/2011 Art. 19)
- **Rate raised from 0.76% → 1.06% from 1 Jan 2024** (L. 213/2023 · Legge di Bilancio 2024 art. 1 c. 91). Verified against AdE scheda.

  - Foreign-pension recipients moving to Mezzogiorno (SI/CL/SA/CM/BA/AB/MO/PU) communes < 20,000 inhabitants → 7% flat tax on all foreign income, 9 years.
  - **Population limit raised 20k → 30k by L. 34/2026 effective 7 Apr 2026** — broadens eligible communes.

- Reported as capital inmobiliario in IRPF; taxed in **base general** at progressive rates up to 47% (state + autonomous).

- Designed to neutralise Madrid/Andalucía wealth-tax bonificación — IP paid is creditable against ITSGF.
- **Real Decreto-ley 8/2023 (27 Dec 2023)** extended ITSGF **indefinitely** ("hasta que no se revise la tributación patrimonial en el marco de la financiación autonómica"). Filed via **Modelo 718** between 1-31 July following the tax year.

### Reporting — Modelo 720 + Modelo 721
- **Modelo 720** (annual, by 31 March): foreign assets > **€50k per category** (accounts / securities-funds-pensions / real estate). Once filed, refile only if value increased > €20k or asset disposed of.
- **ECJ Case C-788/19 (27 Jan 2022)**: M720 penalty regime ruled disproportionate. **Ley 5/2022 (9 Mar 2022)** removed the special penalty regime — now ordinary LGT penalties apply.
- **Modelo 721** since 2024: separate crypto-asset disclosure.

### Inheritance — ISD (Ley 29/1987)
- Worldwide for Spanish-resident heir (or for non-resident on Spanish-situs assets).
- Autonomous variation enormous — **Madrid 99% bonificación · Andalucía 99% direct line · Murcia 99% · Valencia 99% post-Jul-2023**.
- Heir gets **stepped-up basis** at ISD-assessed FMV — no carry-over.
- DTT estate-tax: only ~3 countries.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- 1 Jan 2025: top base-ahorro bracket 28% → **30%** for > €300k.
- ITSGF extended indefinitely (RDL 8/2023).

## Buyer cohort: Netherlands — Wet IB 2001 · AWR · Successiewet 1956

### Tax residence — Art. 4 AWR
Facts-and-circumstances; family ties primary (where the family physically lives weighs heavier than registration). Treaty tie-breaker overlays.

### Foreign real estate — **Box 3 (vermogensbelasting via fictief rendement)**
- Box 3 = deemed (fictitious) return on net wealth on 1 Jan reference date. Not capital gains; not actual rent.
- **Threshold 2026: heffingsvrij vermogen €59,357 / €118,714 fiscal partners** (raised from €57,000 / €114,000 in 2024).
- **Forfait rates 2026**: 1.44% on bank savings · **6.04% on overige bezittingen (incl. real estate, both Dutch and foreign)** · 2.62% on debts.
- Foreign real estate enters at FMV minus mortgage debt. Most DTTs allocate to situs country with NL **vrijstelling met progressievoorbehoud** (treaty exemption with averaging effect on the Box 3 rate calc).
- Valuation: **Hoge Raad** confirmed WOZ-equivalent / market value; for property available for own use, market rental value may be added from 2026.

### Box 3 reform — the live constitutional crisis
- **Hoge Raad 6 Jun 2024** (and 14 Jun 2024 follow-ups, then **20 Dec 2024**): existing Box 3 forfait still violates Art. 1 EP ECHR; **actual return** must cap the levy. **Voordeel wegens eigen gebruik** (own-use benefit) of real estate set to **NIL** for actual-return purposes.
- **Tegenbewijsregeling** ("counter-proof rule"): from 2025 (covering 2017-2024 affected years; 2025+ forward), taxpayers can demonstrate actual return < forfait via **OWR — Opgaaf Werkelijk Rendement** (folded into regular IB return from tax year 2025).
- **Wet werkelijk rendement box 3** — full move to actual-return basis: originally 2026 → postponed to 2027 → **postponed again to 1 Jan 2028**. Tweede Kamer adopted the bill 12 Feb 2026; First Chamber must conclude by 15 Mar 2026 for 2028 to be feasible. Minister Heinen indicated he wants amendments. **Status as of 2026-05-09: bill in First Chamber; substantial change still possible.**

### Box 1 — only if "more than asset management"
If active landlord status (multiple foreign properties + professional involvement) → Box 1 progressive (2025 top rate 49.5%). High threshold; rare for individual foreign-property buyers.

### CGT on disposal — none for individuals
NL has **no separate CGT** for individuals on real estate held privately. Box 3 deemed return only; actual gain on disposal not separately taxed. Treaty allocates to situs country.

### Inheritance — Successiewet 1956
- Worldwide for Dutch-resident decedent.
- **10-year rule (tienjaarsregeling, Art. 3 SW)**: a person of **Dutch nationality** who dies (or makes a gift) within 10 years after emigration is deemed Dutch-resident → Dutch IHT still applies regardless of where assets sit. Non-Dutch nationals: only 1-year window for gifts; no IHT post-emigration.
- Allowances 2024 (verify 2026 figures): spouse €795k · child €25,187 · others €2,690. Rates 10-40% (sliding by class + bracket).

### Reporting
- No comprehensive foreign-asset register equivalent to Modelo 720 / Quadro RW.
- Box 3 question on foreign assets in IB return.
- CRS auto-exchange handles bank/brokerage data.
- Belastingdienst foreign-asset compliance team active; CRS gap-analysis used to surface non-disclosure.

### 2024-2026 reforms
- **30%-ruling**: original 2024 plan was 30/20/10 stair-step; **reversed by Tax Plan 2025** (Senate 17 Dec 2024) → flat **27% from 1 Jan 2027** with €50,436 income standard; existing 30% rulings grandfathered at 30% through 2026.
- Box 3 actual-return Wet WRBox3 → 1 Jan **2028** (verify final First-Chamber adoption).

**Confidence: HIGH** for Box 3 thresholds + 30%-ruling timeline; **MEDIUM-LOW** for the actual-return effective date (still in parliamentary navette) · **Last verified**: 2026-05-09

Tax basis = market value 1 Jan of preceding income year, OR purchase price adjusted by an approved foreign price index.
- **2024 property-tax reform** — new property-tax model effective 1 Jan 2024 (Boligskatteloven). Tax-credit ("skatterabat") protects pre-2024 buyers from any net increase vs. old rules; applies equally to foreign property. UK index approved by Vurderingsstyrelsen with forward effect from 2024.

## Buyer cohort: Switzerland — DBG/LIFD + cantonal Steuergesetze + ESTV

### Tax residence — DBG Art. 3
Unbeschränkte Steuerpflicht via domicile, OR ≥ 30 days physical presence with gainful activity, OR ≥ 90 days without. Worldwide income at federal — but **treaty allocates RE income to situs (Art. 6 OECD MTC)**, so foreign rental is exempted from Swiss tax base, **retained for rate progression**.

### Eigenmietwert (imputed rental) on foreign owner-occupied property
Art. 21 Abs. 2 DBG: notional rental value of foreign primary/secondary residence is **included in Swiss tax base for rate-progression purposes** (then stripped from taxable income via treaty). Practitioner trap: even unrented foreign holiday homes raise Swiss marginal rate.

### Foreign mortgage interest
Deductible against worldwide income subject to **Schuldzinsenabzug-Quote** (debt-allocation by asset location); foreign mortgage on foreign property generally allocates deduction to foreign income source, reducing Swiss benefit.

### Vermögenssteuer (cantonal wealth tax)
Worldwide net wealth INCLUDING foreign RE; rates 0.1-1% by canton (typical bands: ZH 0.07-0.30%, GE 0.4-1%, VS up to 0.5%). Treaty allocates wealth tax on RE to situs — Swiss canton excludes from taxable wealth but **uses for rate progression**.

### CGT — cantonal Grundstückgewinnsteuer
Federal does NOT tax CGT on private RE gain. **Most cantons tax only domestically-located RE** — foreign RE gains typically out of cantonal scope (verify canton).

### Lump-sum / Pauschalbesteuerung
DBG Art. 14: still available federally; **5 cantons abolished cantonally** (ZH, BS, BL, SH, AR).

### Inheritance — cantonal
Spouse exempt in essentially all cantons; children exempt in most (taxed in BL, AG, AR, OW). Foreign RE typically allocated to situs canton/state.

### MAJOR REFORM — Eigenmietwert ABOLISHED
- **Vote**: 28 Sept 2025, **57.7% Yes** — constitutional amendment + new Federal Decree on cantonal property taxes on second homes.
- **Implementation**: **1 January 2029** per Federal Council. ([admin.ch](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20250928/federal-decree-on-cantonal-property-taxes-on-second-homes.html))
- **Effect on foreign property**: imputed rental of foreign owner-occupied home no longer included for rate progression after Jan 2029; foreign property still declarable for **wealth tax progression**.
- **Mortgage interest deduction** also abolished in tandem; transitional 10-year tapered deduction for first-time buyers (married couple: CHF 10k year 1, declining CHF 1k/year to zero).
- **Maintenance/renovation deductions** also abolished.
- **Until 1 Jan 2029**: existing Eigenmietwert-on-foreign-property regime fully in force.

**Confidence: HIGH** (reform passed; effective date locked at 2029) · **Last verified**: 2026-05-09

## Buyer cohort: Asia — JP / KR / SG / HK / CN

### Japan — Income Tax Act (Shotokuzeihō, Act No. 33 of 1965) + NTA
Three-tier residence:
- **Non-resident** — Japan-source only.
- **Non-Permanent Resident (NPR)** — resident but Japan-domiciled < 5 years in last 10. Taxed on Japan-source + foreign-source paid in Japan + foreign-source remitted to Japan.
- **Permanent Resident (PR)** — > 5 years in last 10. Worldwide income.

5-year transition trap: PR status auto-attaches once threshold crossed, NOT linked to immigration "permanent residence" visa. Foreign rental switches from NPR-remittance regime to full taxation.

Foreign rental (PR): fudosan shotoku, comprehensive income; aggregate progressive 5-45% national + 10% local + 2.1% reconstruction surtax.

CGT on foreign disposal:
- **Long-term (> 5y holding)**: 15% national + 5% local + 0.315% reconstruction surtax = **~20.315%**.
- **Short-term (≤ 5y)**: 30% national + 9% local = **~39%+**.

Principal-residence ¥30M deduction (§ 35 ITA) applies to foreign principal residence per NTA practice.

Exit tax (§ 60-2 ITA): **securities/derivatives ≥ ¥100M** held by individuals resident in Japan ≥ 5 of last 10 years before departure (rule from 1 Jul 2015). **Real estate (Japan or foreign) explicitly NOT included.** Flat 15.315% on deemed gain.

Inheritance (sōzokuzei): 10-55% sliding; basic deduction ¥30M + ¥6M × statutory heirs. Worldwide if decedent/heir Japan-resident — **including foreign property**. **10-year tail**: Japanese nationals leaving Japan remain in Japanese inheritance scope for 10 years post-departure (2017 reform). **Visa-based scope**: Table 2 visa holders (PR, spouse-of-Japanese, long-term resident) taxed on worldwide assets if jusho is in Japan.

Foreign-Asset Disclosure (Form 5060 / kokugaizaisanchosho): foreign assets ≥ ¥50M at year-end; understatement penalty 5-30%.

- Inheritance: globally for Korean-resident decedent; rates 10-50% (top rate 50% > KRW 3B); among highest in OECD.
- **2025-28 reform**: National Assembly Dec 2025 passed minor amendments. **Inheritance Acquisition System** — planned shift from estate-tax to per-heir-share, bill submission May 2026, target **2028 (NOT yet enacted)**. Per-child basic deduction proposed KRW 50M → 500M; spouse exemption raised.

- Stamp duty (BSD/SSD/AVD) only on HK property; cooling measures relaxed Feb-Oct 2024 (BSD/SSD/NRSD removed 28 Feb 2024).

## Buyer cohort: Emerging-market — IN · BR · MX · ZA · AE · SA · GCC

The EU-core + common-law regimes above are baseline. Foreign-property buyers also come from emerging-market jurisdictions whose home-tax overlay is materially different (capital controls + outbound-FX taxes + black-money disclosure + Zakat — instead of the EU's wealth-tax + monitoring-form pattern).

- **CBE — Capitais Brasileiros no Exterior** (BCB declaration): mandatory if **assets > USD 1M** at year-end (annual); quarterly if > USD 100M.
- **IOF outbound**: **1.10%** for outbound FX for investment purposes (post-Decree 12,466/2025); **0.38%** for property-purchase remittances at the lower band — IOF rate has been politically volatile through 2025, verify weekly.
- **CRS**: active 2018+ (RFB receives via AEOI).
- **ITCMD inheritance** (state, 2-8%; SP/RJ 4%, MG 5%): EC 132/2023 made progressivity **mandatory** + brought foreign assets into scope; PLP 108/2024 standardisation pending; LC 227/2026 regulates trusts + abroad-asset taxation.
- 2024-26: Lei 14.754/2023 (1 Jan 2024); EC 132/2023 ITCMD progressivity; PLP 108/2024 + LC 227/2026 ITCMD harmonisation.
- **Confidence: HIGH** on Lei 14.754; **MEDIUM** on ITCMD harmonisation final shape.

### Mexico — LISR + SAT
- **Residence** (CFF Art. 9): domicilio + family + centre-of-vital-interests; > 50% income from Mexican source = resident.
- **Worldwide income** (LISR Art. 1): residents — yes.
- **Foreign rental** (resident): LISR Título IV Cap. III — comprehensive ISR up to **35%** marginal; deductions on actual basis OR 35% blind deduction.
- **Foreign CGT** (resident): included in worldwide ISR base; FTC under treaty (LISR Art. 5).
- **Foreign-asset disclosure**: **Anexo 8 / Anexo 9** of annual declaration; REGIN reporting; high penalties Forms 76/77 for transactions with REFIPRES (low-tax) jurisdictions.
- **Inheritance**: federal — none; state — varies (zero in most); worldwide for resident heir.
- **Fideicomiso quirk**: when Mexican holds foreign property via a Mexican trust, § 988-style FX issues arise on the Mexican side; Art. 24 USA-MX DTT relief if US-side property.
- 2024-26: Reforma Hacendaria 2024 announcements; FATCA / CRS continued; SAT enforcement intensification on undeclared foreign accounts.
- **Confidence: HIGH** (LISR + SAT primary). NOTE: a non-resident landlord on Mexican rental faces 25% gross withholding (LISR Art. 158) — that's the source-side, often confused; for the **home** side of a Mexican-resident buying abroad, slab rates apply.

### South Africa — ITA 58/1962 + SARS + SARB
- **Residence** (ITA § 1): "ordinarily resident" common-law test OR physical-presence test (91d in current YOA + 91d in each of 5 prior + 915d aggregate).
- **Worldwide income** (post-2001 source-to-residence reform): yes.
- **Foreign rental**: marginal rate up to **45%**; **§ 6quat** rebate for foreign tax paid (credit method).
- **SARB Exchange Control**:
  - **Single Discretionary Allowance (SDA)**: **R1M/yr** per adult — no SARS clearance under R1M.
  - **Foreign Investment Allowance (FIA)**: **R10M/yr** above SDA — Tax Compliance Status (TCS) PIN from SARS required.
  - Above R11M: SARS Approval for International Transfer (AIT) PIN application + supporting docs.
- **§ 9D Controlled Foreign Company**: net-income attribution to SA-resident participants > 50% / > 10%.
- **CGT on foreign property** (§ 26A): inclusion rate **40%** for individuals × top 45% rate ≈ **18% effective** (~25% in highest brackets).
- **Primary residence exclusion**: **R2M** (raised to **R3M from 1 Mar 2026** per 2026 Budget) — applies to foreign primary residence too if ordinarily resided.
- **§ 9H exit tax**: deemed disposition on cessation of residence — worldwide assets EXCEPT SA-situs immovable. **Foreign property INCLUDED**. R40k annual exclusion, 40% inclusion × marginal rate.
- **Estate Duty Act**: global for resident decedent; **R3.5M abatement**; **20%** rate (25% > R30M).
- **Reporting**: SARS auto-receives via CRS; explicit foreign-asset section on ITR12.
- 2024-26: 2024 Budget left major rates flat; SARS HNW unit enforcement up; AIT PIN process tightened 2024.
- **Confidence: HIGH**.

### UAE — Federal Decree-Law 47/2022 + FTA
- **PIT for individuals**: **NONE**.
- **Foreign rental income** held by UAE-resident individual: **NOT taxable in UAE**. Source-country tax applies.
- **Corporate tax** (eff. **1 Jun 2023**): **9%** on business profits > **AED 375,000**; 0% below.
- **Natural-person CT scope**: triggered when individual conducts a "business activity" with **annual turnover > AED 1M**. Passive foreign rental held in personal name — generally OUT of scope.
- **Reporting**: no individual income tax → no Form 8938 / T1135 / Modelo 720 / Quadro RW equivalent.
- **CRS**: UAE active since 2018 (FATCA earlier).
- **VAT**: 5% on commercial UAE rental; residential exempt.
- **Foreign-property exposure for UAE-resident** is mostly:
  1. Source-country tax (where the property sits).
  2. NEW home-country tax if they relocate (UAE residents often have IN/EG/PK/UK/RU origin — relocation triggers their original system's worldwide rules).
- 2024-26: CT launch (1 Jun 2023); family-foundation regime added 2024 (Cabinet Decision 261/2024); Pillar Two domestic top-up tax for in-scope groups (proposed Jan 2025).
- **Confidence: HIGH** for the no-PIT baseline; MEDIUM for boundary cases.

### Saudi Arabia — Zakat regime + ZATCA
- **Saudi nationals + GCC nationals**: **Zakat 2.5%** on net zakatable assets (not income tax) — ZATCA-administered. Ministerial Resolution 1007 (21 Mar 2024) issued new Executive Regulations effective fiscal years from 1 Jan 2024.
- **Non-Saudi / non-GCC residents**: generally NOT taxable on personal income unless conducting business through PE.
- **Foreign rental** (individual, passive): generally **outside Zakat scope** for non-business individual; ZATCA hasn't published explicit guidance — treat as data-not-publicly-available, verify with tax adviser.
- 2024-26: Zakat Executive Regulations 2024; e-invoicing waves continue.
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** (individual passive foreign-property treatment under-documented).

### QA / KW / OM / BH
- Generally no PIT for individual residents.
- Foreign-property rental income — outside individual tax scope.
- KW partial Zakat (corporates); **OM PIT proposed 2024 but repeatedly deferred** — unconfirmed as of May 2026, verify quarterly.
- CRS active in all four (FATCA earlier).
- **Confidence: MEDIUM** (Oman PIT timing fluid).

## Cross-cutting structural detail

These are the universal lessons that apply REGARDLESS of home jurisdiction. The cross-cutting layer is what differentiates a good due-diligence skill from a country-by-country tax sheet.

### Phantom currency-gain on foreign mortgage payoff (US § 988 + others)

A US person who finances a foreign property with a foreign-currency mortgage, then pays it off when USD has strengthened against that currency, recognises **§ 988 ordinary FX gain** — taxed at marginal rates up to **37%** federal — on the FX swing of the principal. The gain is *phantom*: the homeowner sees no cash benefit; they bought a house, sold the house, paid back the same nominal mortgage. The gain happens because the dollars needed to retire the GBP/EUR/JPY mortgage are FEWER than the dollars they were "obligated to" at acquisition.

- **Anchor case**: ***Quijano v. United States*** (US Tax Court — UK couple sold a UK home; IRS denied integration of FX loss with property gain). Court rejected the § 988(d)(1) hedging-transaction argument because the mortgage wasn't entered into in a trade or business and was personal-use. ([Journal of Accountancy 1997 case note](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/1997/jan/taxcase.html); [Cornell LII 26 USC § 988](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/988)) The case is the canonical citation for "you cannot net the FX loss on a personal mortgage against the gain on the home." (The "Vinaigrette" case sometimes cited colloquially — could not source as a published opinion. Use *Quijano* as citable authority.)
- **§ 988(e) personal-transaction limitation**: losses on personal-use FX positions are NOT deductible — one-way asymmetry (gains taxable, losses not deductible). This is the asymmetry buyers underestimate.
- **AU equivalent**: ITAA 1997 Div 775 — Forex Realisation Event 4 ("Ceasing to have an obligation to pay foreign currency") triggers on foreign-mortgage discharge. Gain assessable; private-or-domestic loss generally not deductible. ([ATO forex events](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/corporate-tax-measures-and-assurance/foreign-exchange-gains-and-losses/forex-realisation-events))
- **CA equivalent**: ITA § 39(2) — forex gain/loss on capital transaction; first CAD 200 personal-use exemption; remainder is capital, not income (less punitive than US but real).
- **JP equivalent**: yen-denominated computation forces FX into the gain calc (ITA § 57-3; treated as miscellaneous income).
- **NOT a trap in (integrated systems)**: UK (*Bentley v Pike* — currency swing folded into CGT, not separate); DE (Anlage V-Ausland integrated computation); FR (CGI Art. 150 U integrated); IT (computed in EUR throughout).

### PFIC trap — foreign collective investment vehicles (US-only but huge)

Any foreign corporation that meets either the income test (≥ 75% passive income) or asset test (≥ 50% passive-income-producing assets) is a **PFIC under IRC § 1297**. Foreign property funds almost always qualify.

| Vehicle | Country | Typical PFIC status |
|---|---|---|
| **SOCIMI** | ES | PFIC (RE > 50% assets, income passive) |
| **SCPI** | FR | PFIC if held as fund-of-fund or outside the direct-REIT-equivalent path; direct status debated ([HTJ Tax SCPI](https://htj.tax/2022/05/us-tax-treatment-of-french-scpi/)) |
| **Offene Immobilienfonds** | DE | PFIC |
| **REIT** (UK / AU LIT-MIT / SG / HK) | various | PFIC for individual US holders (REIT-comparable status doesn't override PFIC tests) |
| Private property syndicate | various | usually PFIC if > 50% RE-passive |

Three regimes for the US holder ([IRS Form 8621 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621)):

- **§ 1291 default**: tax + interest charge on excess distributions / sale gain — punitive, can exceed gain itself for long holds.
- **§ 1295 QEF**: pass-through inclusion — but requires PFIC Annual Information Statement, which most foreign funds don't issue.
- **§ 1296 mark-to-market**: only if PFIC stock is "marketable" on a regulated exchange.

**Mitigation**: hold direct (not via fund); accept that "the US-REIT-style efficient vehicle" rarely exists outside US for US-resident holders; or accept § 1291 pain.

### Wealth tax on overseas property — multi-country footprint

Wealth tax rarely makes the buyer's checklist, but it bites hardest on cross-border footprints because **most DTTs DO NOT cover wealth tax**.

| Country | Tax | Threshold | Worldwide for resident? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FR** | IFI (Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière) | €1.3M | YES — worldwide RE for FR-resident; FR-situs only for non-resident |
| **ES** | Patrimonio + ITSGF | €700k base + €300k habitual; ITSGF > €3M | YES for resident; ES-situs only for non-resident |
| **NO** | Formueskatt | NOK 1.7M (~€150k) | YES — worldwide net wealth |
| **CH** | Vermögenssteuer (cantonal) | varies by canton | YES — worldwide net wealth |
| **NL** | Box 3 | €59,357 / €118,714 (2026) | YES — deemed-return on worldwide assets |
| **IT** | IVIE on foreign RE | no threshold | 1.06% on foreign RE (NB: this is asset-class-specific, not net-wealth) |
| **DK** | Ejendomsværdiskat | DKK 9.4M lower bracket | YES — Danish rates apply to foreign RE uniquely |

Limited estate / wealth-tax DTTs exist (FR-IT, FR-CH, ES-IT, FR-DE 2002 still in force) — but most DTTs allocate income only, not capital stock. **Practitioner trap**: a French resident buying a Madrid pied-à-terre is in scope for BOTH IFI (worldwide) AND Spanish Patrimonio (Spanish-situs) — the FR-ES treaty does not eliminate the overlap on the Madrid flat itself.

### Estate / inheritance-tax patchwork

Bilateral estate-tax treaties are RARE. The US has **16** ([IRS estate & gift treaties](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international)): AU, AT, DK, FI, FR, DE, GR, IE, IT, JP, NL, NO, ZA, SE, CH, UK. Anywhere else — foreign property held by a US-domiciled decedent gets DOUBLE-TAXED on death. Other countries' networks are even thinner: DE has 5 in force (DK, FR, CH, US, GR); FR ~7; IT ~7; ES ~3; NL handful.

- **Common scenarios**:
  - US-domiciled buys a Lisbon flat → Portuguese stamp-duty/IMT-mirror on lifetime transfer + US 40% federal estate tax above $13.99M (2025) / $15M (2026 OBBBA permanent) exemption — no PT-US estate-tax treaty.
  - UK-domiciled (post-FIG-regime 6 Apr 2025) — UK IHT 40% on worldwide estate; treaty coverage mostly old (FR, IT, IN, NL, IE, US, ZA, SE).
- **Mitigation**: foreign-grantor-trust (US § 679 gotcha attached); QDOT for non-citizen spouses; life-insurance wrapper for non-US-tax-treaty estates; jurisdiction-shopping for HNW. **Holding via foreign company** can change estate situs but introduces PFIC + CFC + Form 5471/8865 reporting — net neutral or worse for many retail buyers.
- **TCJA estate-exemption**: US federal exemption made **permanent at $15M from 2026** by OBBBA (4 Jul 2025), indexed from 2025 base. Sunset to ~$7M no longer operative. State-level estate / inheritance taxes (NY/MA/CT/IL/MN/OR/WA/RI/ME/VT/MD/HI/DC + MD/NJ inheritance) layer on without treaty relief.

### Departure / exit-tax events

The buyer who moves to a no-tax jurisdiction (UAE, Monaco, Singapore) often discovers their *departure* triggers a deemed-disposition of foreign assets — including the foreign property they just bought.

| Country | Statute | Trigger | Direct foreign RE in scope? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **US** | IRC § 877A | Covered expatriate (net worth ≥ $2M, avg tax liability, certified) — MTM all worldwide | YES |
| **CA** | ITA § 128.1 | Cease residence | YES (foreign RE included) |
| **AU** | ITAA 1997 CGT event I1 | Cease residence | YES (election to defer for some pre-CGT assets) |
| **DE** | § 6 AStG (post-1 Jan 2022 ATAD reform) | ≥ 7 of last 12y resident; **shareholdings ≥ 1%**; new EU/EEA 7-instalment relief replaced indefinite deferral | NO — direct RE NOT in § 6; shareholdings only |
| **FR** | CGI Art. 167 bis | Shareholdings > €800k or > 50% | NO — direct RE NOT in scope |
| **JP** | ITA § 60-2 | Securities > ¥100M (since 2015) | NO — securities only |
| **KR** | ITA Art. 118-9 | Securities > ₩500M (since 2018) | NO — securities only |
| **NO** | Skatteloven § 10-70 | Shareholdings (post-2024 reform: NOK 3M allowance, 12-y cap) | NO — securities only |
| **IL** | § 100A ITO | Emigration; 10y deferral option | YES (broad scope) |
| **ZA** | ITA § 9H | Cessation of residence — deemed worldwide disposal except SA-situs RE | YES (foreign RE included) |

The pattern: **direct foreign real estate is in exit-tax scope in US/CA/AU/IL/ZA and OUT in DE/FR/JP/KR/NO**. Verify always — case law on "deemed residence break" timing has cost real money.

### Structural decisions — direct vs corp vs trust vs LLC

The single biggest strategic question for a foreign-property buyer with material wealth.

- **Direct ownership**: simple notarial chain; full estate-tax exposure to home country; full transparency (no PFIC); full wealth-tax base; usually best for retail buyers under HNW threshold.
- **Foreign company** (Spanish SL, French SCI, Italian Srl): changes estate-tax situs (shareholding can be re-domiciled; shares may attract different tax regime than RE); but US holder is in **PFIC + Form 5471 / 8865** territory. Common in UK/AU buyer-of-Spain footprints.
- **Foreign trust**: § 679 grantor-trust rule for US persons + Form 3520 + 3520-A; complex but useful for non-US grantor with US beneficiary.
- **Fiscally-transparent SPV / LLC** (UK LLP, US LLC, FR EURL): same flow-through tax as direct ownership PLUS legal-liability shield. Common for Anglos buying Spanish/Italian/Portuguese property — but each home jurisdiction's classification of the entity (transparent vs opaque) determines whether it triggers CFC / PFIC / hybrid-mismatch.
- **Joint ownership with spouse**: US estate scenario hinges on **QDOT** (qualified domestic trust) for non-US-citizen spouses — without it, the unlimited marital deduction is denied on US-situs assets if the survivor is non-citizen.

There is no universally "best" structure. **The right structure depends on (a) home jurisdiction, (b) source jurisdiction, (c) net worth, (d) residency intent, (e) succession plan.** Anyone giving a generic "always use an SCI" recommendation without those five inputs is pattern-matching, not advising.

### Treaty FTC vs treaty exemption — DTT cascade

Real-property income is allocated to the *situs* country under OECD MTC Art. 6 — but BOTH countries can typically tax (Art. 24 Methods).

- **Exemption method (with progression)** — home country exempts the foreign-source RE income, but uses it to bracket-up domestic income. Common in DE / AT / FR / CH. Effect: foreign-source income is "free" but pushes domestic into a higher band.
- **Credit method** — home country taxes worldwide, gives credit for foreign tax paid (capped at home tax on that foreign income). Common in US / UK / CA / AU / JP / IN.

**Practitioner consequence**: a German resident's French rental is exempt-with-progression in DE → effective rate hits domestic income harder. A US resident's French rental is fully taxable in US with FTC → if French tax > US tax on that income, the excess credit carries forward 10 years or back 1 year (limited use).

Verify each treaty's Art. 24 method before assuming. Note: the German Anrechnungsmethode applied to ES rental (DE-ES DTT 2013) is a CREDIT regime — not the exemption-with-progression that applies to most other DE-EU treaties. One-treaty-at-a-time.

### Common Reporting Standard (CRS) visibility

100+ jurisdictions auto-exchange financial-account data annually under the OECD CRS. A bank account at the property-country bank → home tax authority sees it within ~12 months.

- Property *ownership* itself is NOT directly reported via CRS (CRS is account-based, not asset-based) — BUT rental escrow, utility deposits, mortgage payments, notarial trust accounts all leave a CRS-reportable fingerprint.
- Some countries share property-registry data via DTT MLI bilateral exchanges (GR / IT / PT / ES catastros increasingly cross-referenced).
- **Voluntary-disclosure programs** (US Streamlined / IRS Voluntary Disclosure Practice; IN BMA Compliance Window when re-opened; ZA Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme) are the safest path for past non-disclosure — penalties dramatically lower than discovery-driven enforcement.

### Pillar Two GMT for HNW + family-office structures

The OECD Pillar Two **15% global minimum tax** went live **1 Jan 2024** in the EU, UK, AU (IIR), CA, JP, KR. Threshold: MNE groups with consolidated revenue ≥ €750M in 2 of 4 prior years.

- US: announced (Jan 2026) that US-headquartered companies will be **exempt** from Pillar Two — political settlement in flux; verify quarterly.
- Family offices generally below the €750M threshold but some single-family offices with extensive RE portfolios have crossed it.
- Affects **structured ownership**, not direct individual ownership.

### Foreign currency reporting baskets (US Form 1116)

For US holders, the foreign tax credit is computed on **separate Form 1116 per income basket** ([IRS Form 1116 instructions 2025](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1116)):

1. Passive category income
2. General category income
3. Section 951A (GILTI)
4. Foreign branch
5. Section 901(j) (sanctioned)
6. Treaty-resourced specific income
7. Lump-sum distributions

**Foreign rental** = passive (default). **Cross-basket loss not allowed.** The HTKO ("high-tax kick-out") election kicks passive income taxed at > 37% by foreign country into the *general* basket — useful when the foreign country's effective rate exceeds US top rate, allowing better cross-basket utilisation. ([Golding Lawyers HTKO](https://www.goldinglawyers.com/high-tax-kick-out-htko-irs-reduction-in-the-foreign-tax-credit/))

This matters for high-tax jurisdictions (FR, DE, NL, BE, JP) where the foreign rental tax often exceeds US rates → HTKO can save 10-15% on the FTC limitation.

---

## Universal mitigations (apply across all home jurisdictions)

These work regardless of buyer's home country and prevent the most common cross-border tax pitfalls:

1. **Get tax advice in BOTH jurisdictions before signing** — buyer's-side and property-side. The buyer's home-country accountant rarely knows IVIE / Modelo 720 / Schedule FA / Quadro RW filings; the property-country notary rarely knows § 988 / FBAR / T1135. The DTT applies BETWEEN them but neither side automatically computes it.
2. **Voluntary-disclosure pre-CRS-discovery is the safest catch-up path** — US Streamlined / VDP, UK Worldwide Disclosure Facility, IN Black Money Compliance Window when open, IT ravvedimento operoso, ES regularización extraordinaria, BR DERCAT. Penalties on volunteer disclosure are dramatically lower than discovery-driven enforcement (typically 10-25% vs. 50-300% with criminal exposure).
3. **Verify treaty Article 24 method before assuming relief mechanic** — the German Anrechnungsmethode for Spanish rental (DE-ES DTT 2013) is a CREDIT regime; most other DE-EU treaties are Freistellung-mit-Progressionsvorbehalt. Mistaking one for the other inverts the bracket math. Always pull the actual treaty text + protocols at [oecd.org tax conventions](https://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/) or each tax authority's bilateral page.
4. **Pre-departure tax planning windows close fast** — US covered-expatriate Form 8854; CA T1243 + T1244 within 90 days; AU CGT event I1 election within 12 months; ZA § 9H clearance before fund repatriation. Plan emigration timing around the home-country exit-tax event, not just the visa date.
5. **Document FX rates at every transaction date** — for buyers from US (§ 988), AU (Div 775), CA (§ 39(2)), JP (§ 57-3) the FX-translation rule requires per-transaction conversion. Save the bank's FX rate confirmation, the central-bank reference rate (BoC, ATO published, IRS yearly average), and the actual amount transferred. Reconstructing 5 years later is painful and audit-vulnerable.
6. **Don't bypass the foreign-asset disclosure form even when no income is earned** — Modelo 720 (ES), Quadro RW (IT), T1135 (CA), Form 8938 + FBAR (US), Schedule FA (IN) all require declaration of HOLDING the asset, not just income from it. The penalty cascade for non-disclosure independently of any tax owed can dwarf the tax itself.
7. **Avoid foreign collective-investment vehicles for US holders without PFIC analysis** — SOCIMIs, SCPIs, Offene Immobilienfonds, UK REITs are generally PFICs. Even when sold by a US-bank's foreign branch with apparent US compatibility, the underlying vehicle is subject to § 1291. Direct property ownership avoids the entire PFIC regime.

## Honest uncertainties (read before relying)

- **CN inheritance tax** — proposed 2010, never enacted. Treat any "China inheritance tax 20%" claim as fabrication unless dated to a post-NPC enactment.
- **IL Olim status (returning resident exemption)** — 10-year foreign-source exemption under § 14 ITO; the 2026 Knesset reform package proposed narrowing it; current status fluid as of May 2026 — verify with Israel Tax Authority before relying.
- **BR EC 132/2023 ITCMD harmonisation** — PLP 108/2024 + LC 227/2026 are still being implemented state-by-state through 2026; foreign-asset taxation rules vary by state until federal harmonisation completes.
- **US TCJA estate-exemption sunset 1 Jan 2026** — was scheduled to halve; OBBBA (4 Jul 2025) made it permanent at $15M (2026 base, indexed from 2025). Confirm current IRS IRB before estate-planning advice.
- **Saudi individual passive foreign-property rental** — ZATCA's individual-side guidance under-documented; treat as MEDIUM confidence.
- **OM individual income tax** — proposed for 2024 introduction, repeatedly deferred; unconfirmed as of May 2026.
- **CA UHT elimination** — Bill C-15 tabled 18 Nov 2025 proposes elimination 2025+; Royal Assent timing pending.
- **AU residency reform 2021 proposal** — not enacted as of May 2026; treat current 4-test framework as authoritative.
- **NL Wet WRBox3 actual-return** — bill in First Chamber as of date stamp; effective date 1 Jan 2028 not yet locked.
- **FR exit-tax PLF 2026** — National Assembly amendment proposes restoring 15-y holding period; awaiting parliamentary navette completion.
