# Israel 🇮🇱 — Property Due-Diligence Playbook

ISO2: `il`. Status: ✅ Fully populated (researched 2026-04 / 2026-05).

> **🇮🇱 LEAD WARNING — read before any other section.** Israel is a **de facto restricted** market. **~93% of land in Israel is state-owned** and managed by the Israel Land Authority (Reshut Mekarkei Yisrael / RMI / רשות מקרקעי ישראל) on behalf of the State of Israel, the Jewish National Fund (KKL / קק״ל), and the Development Authority. **JNF (KKL) parcels are restricted by charter to Jewish lessees** (subject to ongoing litigation; non-Jewish lessees access KKL-equivalent state parcels via swap). Foreigners can buy private land + non-JNF state-leased land but pay a **non-resident purchase-tax surcharge**. **Active war footing** (Israel-Hamas Oct 2023 → ongoing as of May 2026; Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire Nov 2024) — missile/rocket damage is partially covered by **Karnit / Property Tax Compensation Fund** (state-funded), but insurance markets are disrupted and land devaluation is not compensated. Six- to seven-figure decisions in Israel demand a licensed Israeli **עורך דין מקרקעין** (real-estate attorney) and a **שמאי מקרקעין** (licensed appraiser) — non-negotiable. Verify Tabu (Land Registry) AND RMI lease status — Israel runs a **dual title system** and a parcel can be missing from one register while present in the other.

- **Currency**: ILS (Israeli new shekel, ₪). 1 USD ≈ 3.6–3.8 ILS; 1 EUR ≈ 3.9–4.1 ILS (May 2026 BoI representative rate; FX volatile during wartime — verify at `https://www.boi.org.il/he/Markets/ExchangeRates/Pages/Default.aspx`). Free-floating; Bank of Israel intervenes only in extreme moves; no capital controls on residents/non-residents for property transactions but FET-equivalent KYC applies under the Anti-Money Laundering Order 5761-2000.

Portal: `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/land_registration_and_settlement_of_rights_department` and online inquiries at `https://taboo.gov.il/`. Nesach Tabu (נסח טאבו / title abstract) costs ILS 11 online (2026 fee).
  - **Israel Land Authority / RMI (רשות מקרקעי ישראל)** — administers state-owned land leases (חכירה / hachira). Portal: `https://land.gov.il/`. RMI online services: `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/israel_land_authority`.
  - For ~93% of land, BOTH registers must be checked: Tabu shows the registered lease/owner, RMI shows lease terms, capitalization status, and Heskem Hadash conversion eligibility.
- **Title types** (CRITICAL distinction for foreign buyers):

| Type (Hebrew) | English | Foreign use | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **חופשי / chofshi** | Freehold (private land, "Mukdam" / non-RMI parcels) | ✅ acceptable | ~7% of land; concentrated in pre-1948 properties + post-2009 Heskem Hadash conversions in built-up areas |
| **חכירה / hachira** (RMI state-owned) | Long lease, typically 49+49 years | ✅ acceptable (non-JNF parcels) | Capitalized lease fee paid up-front or annually; transferable subject to RMI consent |
| **חכירה JNF/KKL** | JNF / Keren Kayemeth lease | ⚠️ legally restricted to Jewish lessees | Non-Jewish citizens have accessed via state-parcel swap arrangements; ongoing litigation; see Foreign-buyer section below |
| **Heskem Hadash freehold conversion** | "New Agreement" (post-2009 reform) | ✅ acceptable | Converts state-leased built-up plot to chofshi for capitalization fee (חיוב היוון); applies in many residential zones |
| **East Jerusalem / Area C / Golan / Settlement parcels** | Disputed jurisdiction | 🔴 deed status varies; see Quirks | Some parcels registered under Jordanian/Ottoman pre-1967 systems; international-law status contested; do NOT buy without specialist counsel |

## 🇮🇱 LEAD SECTION: Foreign buyer eligibility

### Bottom line

Foreign nationals **may legally purchase residential property in Israel** subject to: (a) the parcel is on private (chofshi) land OR non-JNF state-leased land, (b) higher non-resident purchase-tax brackets apply (no Olim discount), (c) standard AML/KYC source-of-funds documentation, (d) RMI consent if the underlying parcel is state-leased. The de facto restriction is structural — **~93% of land is state-owned and a sub-portion of that is JNF-restricted by charter**. There is no nominee-style workaround: the land is registered to the lessee and RMI/Tabu vet the registration directly.

### State-land monopoly (~93%)

- **Land ownership composition** (per RMI public communications and KKL annual reports — verify currency at `https://land.gov.il/` and `https://www.kkl.org.il/`):
  - **State of Israel**: ~70% of total land area
  - **Jewish National Fund (JNF / KKL)**: ~12–13%
  - **Development Authority (רשות הפיתוח)**: ~10%
  - **Combined RMI-managed**: ~93%
  - **Private (chofshi)**: ~7%
- **Implication**: when buying residential property in Israel, the contract is overwhelmingly likely to involve a *registered lease on state-owned land* (managed by RMI) rather than a freehold purchase. The owner-of-record on Tabu is the **lessee**, not the underlying landowner.

### Lease structure (חכירה / hachira)

- **Standard term**: 49 years + 49-year renewal option (פרק שני). Capitalized lease (חכירה מהוונת) is the most common modern form — the lessee pays a one-time capitalization fee (~91% of land value as of pre-2009 framework) covering the full 49+49 term.
- **Renewal at end of term**: lessees historically face renegotiation at end-of-term. Pre-2009 the fee structure was opaque; post-2009 framework standardized.
- **Heskem Hadash (New Agreement) — Decision 1185 (2009) and successor decisions**: enables lessees of built-up urban residential parcels to **convert lease to freehold (chofshi) for a capitalization fee**. Eligibility depends on zoning, building density, and parcel type. Verify per-parcel eligibility at RMI office or via authorized appraiser. Source: RMI Decision database `https://land.gov.il/Pages/SearchPagesResults.aspx`.
- **Rural / agricultural / non-built-up parcels**: typically NOT eligible for Heskem Hadash conversion; remain on the 49+49 lease framework.

### JNF (KKL) parcels — Jewish-lessee restriction

- **Legal basis**: KKL Charter (Memorandum and Articles of Association of Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael, registered as a charitable corporation in 1907 in the UK; transferred to Israel under the Keren Kayemet LeIsrael Law 5714-1953). Charter specifies land is held "for the benefit of the Jewish People."
- **Practical effect**: KKL-titled parcels are leased only to Jewish lessees. RMI manages KKL land jointly with state-owned land but enforces the charter.
- **Litigation**: HCJ 9205/04 *Adalah v ILA* (2004) and successor cases challenged the JNF restriction as discriminatory. The compromise reached: when a non-Jewish buyer wins a tender on a JNF parcel, RMI swaps that parcel for an equivalent state-owned (non-JNF) parcel from its inventory, allowing the non-Jewish buyer to receive a non-restricted lease while KKL retains an equivalent area. Source: Israeli Supreme Court database `https://supreme.court.gov.il/`.
- **For foreign buyers**: the JNF restriction primarily affects Israeli Arab citizens. Foreign non-Jewish buyers face the same legal swap mechanism in theory but in practice rarely encounter raw JNF parcels in residential markets — most listed urban property is either chofshi or non-JNF state lease.
- **Verification step**: ask the seller's attorney for a Nesach Tabu (`נסח טאבו`) AND a RMI lease extract (`פלט חכירה / pelet hachira`); the document will identify whether the underlying land is State, JNF (KKL), or Development Authority.

### Non-resident purchase-tax surcharge (Mas Rechisha)

- **Foreign / non-resident buyers do NOT get the Israeli-resident or Olim discounted brackets**. They pay the **investor / second-home scale** — the highest applicable bracket structure.
- **Bracket structure (effective from January 2026, indexed annually; verify current brackets at Tax Authority)**:

| Bracket | Threshold (ILS) | Rate (non-resident / investor scale) |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 – ~6,055,070 | 8% |
| 2 | ~6,055,070+ | 10% |

- **Olim (new immigrants) discount — Section 12 of the Real Estate Taxation Regulations**: a one-time, 7-year window (from 1 year before to 7 years after Aliyah date) reduced rate. As of January 2026 (verify currency):

| Bracket | Threshold (ILS) | Rate (Olim) |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 – ~1,928,220 | 0.5% |
| 2 | ~1,928,220+ | 5% |

- **Israeli-resident "single home" buyer**: progressive 0% / 3.5% / 5% / 8% / 10% scale up to ~ILS 6,055,070 (verify) — *not* available to non-residents.
- **Brackets are inflation-indexed annually on 16 January** to the CBS housing price index. Source: Tax Authority circular page `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/dynamiccollectors/tax-rates-real-estate-purchase`.
- **CRITICAL**: the bracket numbers above are 2026 reference points; verify current values at the Tax Authority page before signing — they shift every year and have been adjusted mid-year by emergency wartime orders since October 2023.

### Karnit (Property Tax Compensation Fund) — wartime damage cover

- **Legal basis**: Property Tax and Compensation Fund Law 5721-1961 (חוק מס רכוש וקרן פיצויים).
- **What it covers**: direct physical war/missile/terror damage to:
  - **Buildings (structures)** — repair or replacement up to fund caps tied to the property's tax-assessed value
  - **Contents (movables)** — capped per-claim
  - **Indirect damages** (loss of business income for evacuee zones) — tighter rules; partial coverage
- **What it does NOT cover**:
  - **Land devaluation** caused by proximity to active conflict (e.g., Otef Aza / Northern border post-October 2023) — owners cannot recover lost market value
  - Property-tax assessed value gap when a property's market value exceeds the assessed cap — the gap is uncovered
  - Damage from internal causes (fire, earthquake) — those go to private insurance / Mavat Ra'ash (national earthquake fund framework, separate)
- **Funding**: state-funded (treasury allocation), supplemented historically by a property-tax surcharge. The fund has paid out **tens of billions of ILS** since October 2023 for war damage in Otef Aza, Northern Israel, and central-Israel rocket-impact incidents (verify current figures at Karnit publications).
- **Claim process**: file via Tax Authority Karnit portal `https://www.misim.gov.il/`; deadlines extended for active-conflict zones by emergency order.
- **Implication for foreign buyers**: Karnit substantially de-risks war-damage to the structure but does NOT compensate land-value loss — a property in or near an evacuated zone may retain Karnit coverage for damage but lose 30–60% of market value with no compensation pathway.

### War footing — current status (as of May 2026)

- **Israel-Hamas (Gaza) war**: started 7 October 2023; ongoing operations as of May 2026; Otef Aza (Gaza envelope, ~30 km radius) communities partially repopulated, partial reconstruction.
- **Israel-Hezbollah (Lebanon)**: hostilities September–November 2024; ceasefire 27 November 2024 (verify currency at Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_foreign_affairs`); Northern border evacuees gradually returning.
- **Houthi (Yemen) missile/UAV strikes**: intermittent strikes against central Israel through 2024–2026; air defense generally effective; occasional impacts.
- **Insurance market**: many private insurers reduced or excluded war-coverage riders; **Karnit central** for war-damage compensation; private insurance covers theft, fire, earthquake (separate framework), water damage. Verify with Israel Insurance Association `https://www.iia.org.il/` and your private carrier.

### Mortgage / financing for non-residents

- **Bank of Israel limits** (Banking Supervision Department, Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive 329):
  - **Non-resident foreign buyer**: maximum LTV typically **50%** (varies by bank; some go to 60% with strong credit). Source: BoI directive page `https://www.boi.org.il/he/banking-supervision/regulations/`.
  - **Israeli first home**: up to 75% LTV
  - **Israeli second home / investor**: up to 50% LTV
- **Currency**: most non-resident mortgages offered in ILS; some banks offer USD/EUR-denominated mortgages with FX conversion at drawdown — discuss with the lender.
- **Documentation**: source-of-funds (under AML Order); tax-residency declaration (FATCA/CRS); often Israeli attorney's confirmation of clean title.

### Buyer due diligence — minimum checklist

1. **Nesach Tabu (טאבו abstract)** — verify ownership, encumbrances (`עיקולים`/garnishments, `משכנתאות`/mortgages, `הערות אזהרה`/warning notices). Order online ILS 11 at `https://taboo.gov.il/` (2026 fee).
2. **RMI lease extract (פלט חכירה)** — verify lease term, capitalization status, JNF vs State vs Development Authority, Heskem Hadash eligibility. Order at RMI office or via attorney.
3. **Rishum Mekarkein** — alternate registry for some pre-1969 unsettled parcels (`רישום מקרקעין לא מוסדרים`); attorney must check both.
4. **Building permit + completion certificate (היתר בנייה + טופס 4)** — issued by the local municipality; verifies the structure was legally built and inhabitable. Unauthorized additions (חריגות בנייה) are extremely common and **not always visible at viewing** — request the hetter and Form 4 directly from municipality.
5. **Tabu rights map (תשריט)** + RMI parcel map — surveyed boundaries; commission a licensed surveyor (`מודד מוסמך`) for boundary verification on rural parcels.
6. **Karnit / war-damage history** — for properties in or near border zones (Otef Aza, Galilee, Golan), check claim history with the seller and request a Karnit clearance. Damage history affects market value and future insurability.
7. **Va'ad Bayit / building committee balance** — for apartments under condominium (Bait Meshutaf / בית משותף) regime, request statement of arrears and reserve fund (קרן שיקום).
8. **Licensed Israeli real-estate attorney (עורך דין מקרקעין)** — the buyer's attorney is legally responsible for verifying clean title and registering the transfer; standard fee 0.5–2% + VAT (currently 18% as of January 2025; verify at Tax Authority).
9. **Licensed appraiser (שמאי מקרקעין)** — independent valuation, especially for non-residents; ~ILS 3,000–8,000 typical.

### Confidence

**HIGH** for legal framework (Land Taxation Law, RMI structure, Karnit framework, mortgage LTV limits — all primary statutes published in Reshumot / `https://www.gov.il/`). **MEDIUM** for current bracket numbers (annual indexation; verify at signing). **MEDIUM** for war-zone insurability (private market disrupted post-Oct 2023; conditions evolving).

### Price benchmarks (Q1 2026 reference — verify on Tax Authority transaction database for the specific neighborhood)

> **Source warning**: Yad2/Madlan/OnMap are listing-platforms (asking prices). Use the **Tax Authority transaction database** at `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/dynamiccollectors/realestate_purchase_data` for the specific street to see realized prices. CBS index gives macro trend.

| Locality | Segment | ILS/sqm range | USD/sqm est. (3.7 ILS/USD) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tel Aviv** (central, Lev Ha'ir, Florentin, north city) | Resale apartment | 50,000–110,000 | ≈ $13,500–$29,700 | Madlan + Yad2 + Tax Authority transactions Q1 2026 |
| **Tel Aviv** (luxury — Rothschild, Neve Tzedek, Tel Aviv Port) | New / luxury apartment | 80,000–200,000+ | ≈ $21,600–$54,000+ | Madlan + Komo Q1 2026 |
| **Jerusalem** (central, Rehavia, German Colony, Talbieh) | Apartment | 35,000–75,000 | ≈ $9,500–$20,300 | Yad2 + Tax Authority Q1 2026 |
| **Jerusalem** (Anglo-heavy: Baka, Old Katamon, Arnona) | Apartment | 40,000–85,000 | ≈ $10,800–$23,000 | Yad2 + Anglo-List Q1 2026 |
| **Haifa** (Carmel, Hadar, German Colony) | Apartment | 18,000–40,000 | ≈ $4,860–$10,800 | Yad2 + Tax Authority Q1 2026 |
| **Netanya / Herzliya / Ra'anana** | Apartment | 30,000–70,000 | ≈ $8,100–$18,900 | Yad2 + Madlan Q1 2026 |
| **Beersheba (Be'er Sheva)** | Apartment | 12,000–25,000 | ≈ $3,240–$6,750 | Yad2 + Tax Authority |
| **Eilat** | Apartment | 20,000–45,000 | ≈ $5,400–$12,160 | Yad2 |
| **Tiberias / Tzfat / Galilee periphery** | Apartment / house | 12,000–30,000 | ≈ $3,240–$8,100 | Yad2 (data thin in some communities) |
| **Otef Aza / Gaza envelope (post-Oct 2023 zone)** | Variable | data not publicly indexed in normal CBS series during active-conflict period | — | Verify at Tax Authority transaction database; many transactions paused; specialist counsel mandatory |

> Ranges are listing-derived where Tax Authority data isn't aggregated; verify realized prices for the specific street/building via the Tax Authority transactions database before any offer.

### Compute

1. **Price/sqm** = listing ILS ÷ usable area (`שטח עיקרי` / shetach ikari). **Trap**: many Israeli listings advertise total area (`שטח כולל`) including balconies (`מרפסת`), service areas (`שטח שירות`), and storage (`מחסן`) — clarify which area metric.
2. **Compare to Tax Authority transactions** for the same street + recent 12 months. This is the **realized-price benchmark**.
3. **Compare to CBS index** for the macro trend in the city.
4. **Pull Madlan neighborhood overlay** for transaction comps + price-per-sqm distribution.
5. **Trap (lease vs freehold pricing)**: chofshi (freehold) parcels typically command a **5–15% premium** over equivalent state-leased (chachira) units. The premium reflects RMI consent risk + lease-renewal exposure.
6. **Trap (parking + storage)**: in Tel Aviv, dedicated parking (חניה) adds ILS 250,000–500,000+ per spot; storage (מחסן) adds ILS 50,000–150,000. Verify whether the listing price includes them.

### Confidence

**HIGH** for Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa pricing (CBS index + Tax Authority transactions + multiple listing platforms agree). **MEDIUM** for periphery (Galilee, Negev) — thinner transaction sample. **LOW** for Otef Aza / Northern-border evacuee zones during active-conflict reporting period.

---

## Section: `--traffic`

### Primary sources

- **Netivei Israel (נתיבי ישראל / National Roads Company)** — traffic counts on inter-urban roads.
  - Portal: `https://www.iroads.co.il/`
  - Traffic data publication: search "סקרי תנועה" / "נפח תנועה" via the site
- **Ministry of Transport (משרד התחבורה)** — annual traffic statistics; `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_transport_and_road_safety`
- **CBS Transport Statistics** — `https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/subjects/Pages/תחבורה.aspx`
- **Local municipality traffic department** — for urban arterial counts (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa publish their own counts intermittently)
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** — fallback for road class

### Verdict bands (vehicles per day, AADT-equivalent)

- 🟢 < 2,000 v/d: rural agricultural road, kibbutz access, side street
- 🟡 2,000–10,000 v/d: small inter-urban, urban side street
- 🟠 10,000–40,000 v/d: regional trunk, urban arterial
- 🔴 > 40,000 v/d: national highway (Kvish 1, 2, 4, 6 toll), urban core arterial

### Coarse fallback (OSM `highway` tag)

- `motorway` = Kvish 6 (Highway 6 / Trans-Israel Toll), parts of Kvish 1, 2, 4, 20
- `trunk` = primary inter-urban (Kvish 90, 40, 65)
- `primary` = regional (3-digit national roads)
- `secondary` = inter-village
- `tertiary` = urban collector
- `residential` = neighborhood / shchunah

### Quirks

- **Kvish 6 (Trans-Israel Toll Highway)**: tolled, electronic-tolled (no booths), national north-south route. Traffic data published by toll operator Derech Eretz and Netivei Israel.
- **Tel Aviv arterials (Ayalon / איילון, Ibn Gabirol, Allenby, Begin)**: heavy congestion at peak; AADT understates noise/pollution due to stop-and-go.
- **Jerusalem Light Rail (הרכבת הקלה)**: Red, Green (under construction/opened 2025), Blue lines reshape arterial flow; properties on light-rail corridor see noise + value uplift simultaneously.
- **Border roads (Kvish 90 along Jordan Valley, Kvish 232 in Otef Aza)**: traffic data may be intermittent during security operations.

### Confidence

**MEDIUM** — Netivei Israel publishes counts on national network but coverage is less granular than EU equivalents. For urban arterials, municipality data is patchy. Use OSM road-class as a baseline and verify with on-site visit for borderline properties.

---

## Section: `--tax`

### Annual property tax — Arnona (ארנונה)

**Israel does NOT have a national annual property tax**. Each of the 257 local authorities levies a **municipal property tax called Arnona** (legal basis: Local Authorities (Property Taxes Exemption) Law 5727-1967, plus annual local budget orders).

- **Computed**: by built area (`שטח בנוי` in m²) × per-m² rate set in the municipality's annual ordinance (`חוק עזר ארנונה`). Rates vary by:
  - Property classification (residential, commercial, industrial, vacant)
  - Neighborhood (`איזור ארנונה`) — most municipalities define 2–6 zones with different rates
  - Building age (some municipalities discount for older / preserved buildings)
- **Annual indexation**: Ministry of Interior caps the year-on-year increase (typically published October/November for the coming calendar year). Source: `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_interior`.
- **Discounts** (`הנחות ארנונה`): standard discounts for olim (up to 90% in first year), pensioners, single-parent, disabled, large families — typically the buyer cannot inherit the seller's discount.
- **Range** (residential, 2026):
  - **Tel Aviv-Yafo** (Zone A): ~ILS 75–110/m²/year (verify current at `https://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/`)
  - **Jerusalem**: ~ILS 60–90/m²/year (verify at `https://www.jerusalem.muni.il/`)
  - **Haifa**: ~ILS 50–75/m²/year
  - **Periphery / smaller towns**: ~ILS 30–60/m²/year
  - **Kibbutzim / regional councils**: variable, often lower (special arrangements)
- **Example calculation**:
  - 90 m² apartment in central Tel Aviv at ~ILS 92/m²/year → ~ILS 8,280/year (~$2,240/year est. at 3.7 ILS/USD)
  - 100 m² apartment in central Jerusalem at ~ILS 78/m²/year → ~ILS 7,800/year (~$2,110/year est.)
  - **Verify exact rate on the seller's last Arnona bill (חשבון ארנונה)** — the most reliable source.

### Transaction tax — Mas Rechisha (מס רכישה)

**Mas Rechisha is the buyer's purchase tax.** Brackets indexed annually on **16 January** to CBS housing index. Verify current values at `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/dynamiccollectors/tax-rates-real-estate-purchase`.

#### 2026 reference brackets (verify before signing — these change every January)

**Israeli resident, single residential home (zakaut le-dira yechida — זכאות לדירה יחידה)**:

| Bracket | Threshold (ILS) | Rate |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 – ~1,978,745 | 0% |
| 2 | ~1,978,745 – ~2,347,040 | 3.5% |
| 3 | ~2,347,040 – ~6,055,070 | 5% |
| 4 | ~6,055,070 – ~20,183,565 | 8% |
| 5 | ~20,183,565+ | 10% |

**Israeli resident, second home / investor (mashka'ot — משקיעים)**:

| Bracket | Threshold (ILS) | Rate |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 – ~6,055,070 | 8% |
| 2 | ~6,055,070+ | 10% |

**Non-resident / foreign buyer**: same as Israeli investor scale — **8% / 10%** (no discount).

**Olim (within 7-year window — Section 12 of regulations)**:

| Bracket | Threshold (ILS) | Rate |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 – ~1,928,220 | 0.5% |
| 2 | ~1,928,220+ | 5% |

#### Worked examples

- **Foreign buyer, ILS 4,000,000 apartment**: 4,000,000 × 8% = **ILS 320,000 Mas Rechisha** (~$86,500 est.)
- **Foreign buyer, ILS 8,000,000 apartment**: (6,055,070 × 8%) + (1,944,930 × 10%) = 484,406 + 194,493 = **~ILS 678,899** (~$183,500 est.)
- **Oleh, ILS 4,000,000 apartment within 7-year window**: (1,928,220 × 0.5%) + (2,071,780 × 5%) = 9,641 + 103,589 = **~ILS 113,230** (~$30,600 est.)
- **Foreign vs Oleh on same ILS 4M apartment**: foreign pays ILS 320,000; Oleh pays ILS 113,230 — **the Olim discount saves ~ILS 206,770 (~$55,900 est.)** on this transaction.

### Capital gains — Mas Shevach (מס שבח)

- **Legal basis**: Land Taxation (Appreciation and Purchase) Law 5723-1963, Chapter Three.
- **Standard rate**: 25% on the real (CPI-indexed) capital gain for individuals; 23% for corporations (matching corporate tax rate).
- **Linear formula**: gain accrued before 7 November 2001 is taxed at the marginal income-tax rate of the seller (up to 50%); gain accrued from 7 November 2001 onward is taxed at the flat 25%. Sellers compute via the official Mas Shevach Linear Calculator at the Tax Authority site.
- **Primary residence exemption (פטור מדירה יחידה)**: Israeli-resident sellers who own a single residential dwelling and have held it ≥ 18 months may claim a full Mas Shevach exemption (subject to ownership-history conditions). Source: Tax Authority `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/topics/real_estate_taxation`.
- **Non-resident sellers**: typically pay 25% on the post-2001 gain; primary-residence exemption rarely applies (requires Israeli residency conditions).
- **Withholding at sale**: buyer's attorney withholds an interim Mas Shevach (`ניכוי במקור`) at closing and remits to Tax Authority; final assessment within 4 years.

### Other transaction-related taxes / fees

- **VAT (מע"מ)**: 18% (effective 1 January 2025, raised from 17%; verify at `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/topics/vat_information`). Applies to **new-build sales by developers**, not to second-hand sales between individuals. New-build advertised prices may include or exclude VAT — clarify per listing.
- **Heitel Hashbacha (היטל השבחה / betterment levy)**: 50% of the valuation uplift from a planning-permission upgrade (rezoning, density increase). **Seller pays** at sale. Verify with municipality whether any TBA (תב"ע) plan affects the parcel.
- **Mas Mechira (מס מכירה)**: ABOLISHED 1 August 2007 for individuals (still applies in some corporate contexts; check with Tax Authority).
- **Tabu registration fee**: variable, modest (typically ILS 1,500–3,000 for a standard apartment registration). Source: Land Registry fee schedule `https://taboo.gov.il/`.
- **RMI consent / capitalization fee** (if state-leased): variable; ranges from negligible (pre-paid lease) to several percent of land value (Heskem Hadash conversion).
- **Buyer attorney**: 0.5–2.0% + VAT (18%) typical; standardized minimum fees published by Israel Bar Association `https://www.israelbar.org.il/`.
- **Real estate broker (תיווך)**: typical 2% + VAT each side (buyer + seller pay 2% each); regulated under the Real Estate Brokers Law 5756-1996 — broker must be licensed (`רישיון מתווך`).

### Future risk

- **Annual bracket indexation in mid-January** can shift thresholds materially.
- **Wartime emergency tax orders** since October 2023 have included temporary purchase-tax adjustments and Karnit-funding surcharges; verify currency at signing.
- **Periodic political proposals** to raise non-resident Mas Rechisha (most recently discussed 2024) — not enacted as of May 2026.
- **Heitel Hashbacha enforcement** strengthening — many municipalities catching up on uncollected betterment levies.

## Section: `--rental`

### Long-term residential

- **Tax regime — choice of three** (legal basis: Income Tax Ordinance §122 + 122A):
  - **Full exemption track** (קו פטור): if monthly rental income from all residential properties ≤ ILS 5,654 (2026 threshold; verify currency at Tax Authority) — fully exempt from income tax. Useful for small landlords.
  - **10% flat-rate track** (קו 10%): pay 10% flat tax on gross rental income; no expense deductions; no abatement; mandatory advance-payment by 30 January following tax year. Most common for small-to-mid landlords.
  - **Standard income tax track** (מסלול רגיל): rental income added to other income; taxed at marginal bracket (10–50% range); deduct actual expenses (depreciation, mortgage interest, repairs, agent fees). Best for high-cost / high-leverage scenarios.
- **Non-residents**: typically 10% track or standard track; no exemption-track for non-Israeli-resident landlords (§122 limits exemption to Israeli residents).
- **Tenant-protection law**: Tenancy Law 5731-1971 (חוק השכירות והשאילה); reformed substantially 2017 (Fair Rent Law / חוק שכירות הוגנת) — sets minimum standards (working appliances, safety, mold-free), restrictions on landlord termination during tenancy, deposit caps (max 3 months' rent or 1/3 of lease value).
- **Standard contract**: 12 months with renewal option; termination requires 60–90 days notice depending on lease term.

### Short-term rentals (Airbnb / Booking)

- **Status**: legal but increasingly regulated. National framework still evolving (proposed STR registration law debated 2023–2025; as of May 2026 verify current status at Knesset).
- **Tel Aviv-Yafo**: most stringent — Tel Aviv has discussed mandating short-let registration, building-association consent, and per-unit caps. Verify at `https://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/`.
- **Tax**: short-term rental income generally classified as **business income** (not §122 residential rental) when:
  - Property is offered for short-let (< 6 months at a time)
  - Active management / marketing (Airbnb / Booking listings)
  - Multiple turnovers per year
- **VAT trigger**: if annual short-let revenue > ILS ~120,000 (2026 osek patur threshold; verify), VAT registration becomes mandatory at 18%.
- **Building-association (Va'ad Bayit) consent**: under Land Law 5729-1969 §59A and amendments, condominium owners cannot run a "hotel-like" operation without by-law amendment from the building's general assembly (`אסיפה כללית`). Many Tel Aviv buildings have passed by-laws prohibiting Airbnb.
- **Local accommodation tax**: some municipalities (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Eilat) collect a guest tax (`מס תיירים` / accommodation levy) on short-let stays — verify per municipality.
- **Eilat special status**: VAT-exempt zone (Eilat Free Zone Law 5745-1985); short-let rates for Eilat differ from rest of Israel.

### Strategic notes

- **Tel Aviv + Jerusalem central + Eilat + Tiberias** — strongest short-let demand but highest regulatory pressure.
- **Coastal cities (Netanya, Bat Yam, Ashdod, Herzliya)** — moderate demand, less regulation.
- **Periphery (Galilee, Negev, Otef Aza)** — limited demand outside specific tourism niches; war-zone risk for Northern + Southern border properties.
- **Anglo-Olim long-let market**: strong rental demand from English-speaking olim in Jerusalem (Baka, Old Katamon, German Colony), Ra'anana, Modi'in — premium rents possible.

### Job platforms

- **AllJobs (אול-ג'ובס)**: `https://www.alljobs.co.il/` — largest Israeli platform
- **Drushim (דרושים)**: `https://www.drushim.co.il/`
- **JobMaster**: `https://www.jobmaster.co.il/`
- **LinkedIn IL** — extremely active in tech, finance, Anglo-Olim networks
- **Israemploy** — `https://www.israemploy.net/` (Anglo-Olim focused, English)
- **Nefesh B'Nefesh** — `https://www.nbn.org.il/` (Aliyah + employment for Anglo Olim)
- **Government job portal** — `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/dynamiccollectors/jobs_for_civil_service_employees` (state employment)

### Self-employment regimes

- **Osek Patur (עוסק פטור)**: VAT-exempt micro-business; 2026 turnover ceiling **ILS ~120,000/year** (verify at Tax Authority, indexed annually). Files annual income tax; no VAT; bituach leumi (national insurance) + bituach bri'ut (health insurance) on net income.
- **Osek Murshe (עוסק מורשה)**: standard VAT-registered self-employed; charges 18% VAT (effective Jan 2025); files bi-monthly VAT returns; annual income tax; full bituach leumi.
- **Hevra Ba'am (חברה בע"מ / Ltd company)**: corporate tax 23% (2026); useful above ~ILS 600k profit or for specific structures.
- **Bituach Leumi (national insurance + health)**: combined ~12–17% on self-employed income up to a cap; pays for state pension, disability, healthcare.

### Salaried benchmarks (CBS data, 2025; verify at `https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/subjects/Pages/שכר-ותעסוקה.aspx`)

- **Average monthly gross 2025**: ~ILS 13,500 (verify CBS current; pre-tax)
- **Tel Aviv tech sector**: ~ILS 25,000–50,000/month (senior engineer / mid-level PM)
- **Periphery / non-tech**: ~ILS 8,000–15,000/month
- **Minimum wage 2026**: ~ILS 5,880/month (verify; updated periodically; current at `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_economy_and_industry`)

### Anglo-Olim profession quirks

- **Licensed professions** (medicine, law, accounting, psychology, dentistry, pharmacy, engineering, teaching): require Israeli license — many Anglo Olim require local exams + Hebrew proficiency; **Misrad HaBriut** (Health Ministry), **Lishkat HaDin** (Bar Association), **Lishkat HaRoeh Heshbon** (Accountants).
- **Tech (high-tech / hi-tech / היי-טק)**: English-language work environment dominant in Tel Aviv; Anglo Olim hire easily without Hebrew; competitive global salaries.
- **Remote / international work** (consulting, content, online teaching, etc.): widely viable; tax-residency complexity (likely Israeli tax resident if >183 days; foreign tax credit per treaty).
- **Real-estate brokerage**: requires Israeli license (`רישיון מתווך`) under Real Estate Brokers Law 5756-1996; Hebrew proficiency typically expected.

### Catchment heuristics

- Within Tel Aviv metro / Gush Dan: full salaried + freelance opportunity
- Within Jerusalem corridor (Modi'in, Beit Shemesh): commutable to Tel Aviv (60–90 min) + Jerusalem (30–45 min)
- Periphery (Galilee, Negev, Eilat): thinner labor markets; remote / tourism / agriculture / specific industries (chemicals in Mitzpe Ramon; tech in Yokne'am, Caesarea)
- Border / evacuee zones (Otef Aza, Northern border post-Oct 2023): labor markets disrupted; verify current employment status before relocating

### Earthquake risk

- **Israel sits on the Dead Sea Transform fault** — left-lateral fault running Aqaba → Dead Sea → Jordan Valley → Hula Valley → Lebanon. Historical major events: 1927 Jericho M 6.2; 1837 Galilee M 6.5–7.0; 1759 Galilee–Lebanon M 7.4.
- **Standard SI 413** mandates earthquake-resistant design for new buildings since 1975 (revised 1995, 2004, 2013, 2020). Pre-1980 buildings frequently NOT compliant.
- **TAMA 38** (National Outline Plan 38, in force 2005–2022): incentivized seismic-retrofit of pre-1980 buildings via density bonuses. **Sunset 1 October 2022**; replaced by local outline plans (תוכניות מתאר מקומיות) and TAMA 70. Many Tel Aviv buildings underwent or are awaiting TAMA 38 retrofit.
- **Risk ranking**: 🟠–🔴 in Jordan Valley / Beit She'an Valley / Galilee fault belt; 🟡 along central coast and Tel Aviv; 🟢 most Negev (lower fault density).
- **Insurance**: standard homeowner policies (`ביטוח דירה`) typically include earthquake cover but verify per policy.

### Missile / rocket / war-damage risk

- **Karnit-covered** (state-funded compensation for direct property damage) — see Foreign-buyer section above.
- **Mamad (מ.מ.ד / shelter room)**: mandatory in all new residential construction since 1992 (Civil Defense Law 5711-1951 amendment). Pre-1992 buildings have public shelters (`מקלט ציבורי`) within 90 seconds run.
- **Otef Aza (Gaza envelope)**: ~30 km radius around Gaza Strip; active rocket/missile/UAV threat October 2023–ongoing. Karnit claim volumes have run into tens of billions ILS since Oct 2023.
- **Northern border (Galilee + Golan)**: Hezbollah hostilities Sep–Nov 2024; ceasefire Nov 2024; partial repopulation as of May 2026.
- **Central Israel** (Tel Aviv–Gush Dan, Jerusalem corridor): Houthi (Yemen) UAV/missile strikes intermittent through 2024–2026; Iron Dome / Arrow / David's Sling intercept rates high but not 100%.

### Flood / wadi / flash-flood risk

- **Coastal cities**: storm-surge + drainage flooding (Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Netanya periodically). Verify flood-zone status with municipality and Hydrological Service.
- **Negev / Arava / Dead Sea**: arid, but **flash floods** (`שיטפון`) in wadis after rare heavy rain — extremely dangerous; check wadi-channel proximity before buying rural southern property.
- **Galilee / Northern**: winter rain + steep terrain → localized flooding; routine engineering controls.

### Build-era hazards

| Era | Hazards |
|---|---|
| **Pre-1948** (Ottoman / British Mandate) | Pre-Mamad; pre-SI 413; lead, asbestos in roofing common; weak foundations; frequent unauthorized additions |
| **1948–1967** (early state, "shikun" social housing — `שיכון`) | Pre-SI 413 (1975); asbestos in roofing/insulation common; weak earthquake resilience; aging plumbing |
| **1968–1991** | SI 413 from 1975 partial; asbestos in older sections; Mamad NOT mandatory |
| **1992+ (post-Mamad mandate)** | Mamad mandatory; SI 413 revised; modern standards |
| **Post-2005 TAMA 38 era** | Many pre-1980 buildings retrofitted seismically |
| **Post-2020 SI 413 revision** | Strongest earthquake standards |

- **Asbestos**: pre-1990 buildings frequently contain asbestos (roofs, pipe insulation, wall panels). Removal regulated by Asbestos Hazards Prevention Law 5771-2011; mandatory licensed contractor for friable asbestos. Source: `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/topics/asbestos_dust_pollution`.

### Mandatory diagnostics at sale

| Document | Required because | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Nesach Tabu (טאבו abstract)** | All sales | ILS 11 online via `https://taboo.gov.il/` |
| **RMI lease extract (פלט חכירה)** | If state-leased | At RMI office or via attorney |
| **Building permit + Form 4 (היתר בנייה + טופס 4)** | All sales | From local municipality |
| **Architectural drawings (תוכנית אדריכלית)** | Recommended | Verify built area matches permit |
| **Va'ad Bayit clearance** | If apartment under Bait Meshutaf | Statement of arrears + reserve fund (קרן שיקום) |
| **Heitel Hashbacha clearance** | All sales | Confirms no outstanding betterment levy |
| **Arnona clearance (אישור היעדר חובות ארנונה)** | All sales | Required for Tabu registration |
| **Energy rating (דירוג אנרגטי)** | New construction since 2017 | Mandatory for new builds |

### Climate change projections (IMS / Israel Meteorological Service + IPCC AR6)

- +1.5–3.5 °C by 2050 vs 1981–2010 baseline (depending on SSP)
- Increased heat-wave frequency + duration (esp. Jordan Valley, Negev, Beit She'an)
- Drying summers + wetter winters projected
- Sea-level rise: ~30–60 cm by 2100 (RCP 4.5–8.5) along Mediterranean coast → coastal Tel Aviv–Bat Yam–Ashkelon assets need long-horizon assessment
- Wildfires: rising in Carmel, Jerusalem corridor forests
- Water-table stress in coastal aquifer (saltwater intrusion)

---

## Section: `--mains`

### Water + sewer service

Israel has **near-universal mains water + sewer in urban areas** but verification is necessary in rural / kibbutzim / moshavim / Bedouin villages / Arab villages with informal infrastructure.

### Operators

- **Mei Avivim (מי אביבים)** — Tel Aviv-Yafo + Bat Yam; subsidiary structure
- **Hagihon (הגיחון)** — Jerusalem
- **Mei Carmel (מי כרמל)** — Haifa region
- **Mei Sharon (מי השרון)** — Sharon coastal corridor
- **Mei Avot (מי אבות)** — Petah Tikva, Rishon LeZion area
- **Many regional/municipal water corporations** — each major city has its own corporate utility under the Water Companies Law 5701-2001
- **Mekorot (מקורות)** — national water carrier (wholesale; not consumer-facing usually)
- **Water Authority (רשות המים)** — regulator; `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/water_authority`

### Verification

1. Listing language:
   - "מחובר למים ולביוב" / "tap-water + sewer connected" = urban mains
   - "מים מהמקור הישוב" / "boer יישוב" = village/kibbutz water (verify quality + reliability)
   - "ביוב פרטי" / "septic" = private septic — common in older periphery houses
2. Check **municipality website** under "מים וביוב" / "water and sewer" — most publish coverage
3. Most populated municipalities (>5,000 residents) have full mains coverage
4. **Bedouin unrecognized villages (Negev)**: many lack formal water/sewer + electricity infrastructure → specialist due diligence
5. **Settlement-area properties (Area C / Golan / disputed jurisdictions)**: utility provider may differ; verify operator + legal status

### Costs

| Scenario | Cost (ILS) |
|---|---:|
| Connection where available | 5,000–25,000 |
| Sewer connection construction | 30,000–100,000 |
| Septic to mains conversion | 50,000–150,000 |
| Modern compliant septic install | 60,000–180,000 |
| Water meter installation | nominal (covered by utility) |

---

## Cost benchmarks (IL 2026)

| Work | Cost (ILS) |
|---|---:|
| Buyer attorney (סדר רכישה) | 0.5–2.0% of price + VAT (18%) |
| Real-estate broker (תיווך) | 2% + VAT (each side) |
| Licensed appraiser (שמאי מקרקעין) | 3,000–8,000 |
| Tabu registration fee | 1,500–3,000 |
| Nesach Tabu (online abstract) | 11 |
| RMI lease extract / consent | 200–2,000 (varies) |
| Heskem Hadash conversion (capitalization) | varies — % of land value (verify per parcel) |
| **Mas Rechisha (foreign buyer)** | 8–10% of purchase price |
| **Annual Arnona (90 m² Tel Aviv)** | ~6,500–10,000 |
| Asbestos removal (200 m² roof) | 30,000–80,000 |
| TAMA 38 / TAMA 70 retrofit cost (per unit, paid by developer in exchange for density bonus) | typically nil to owner; structured as construction-financed deal |
| Mamad retrofit (adding shelter to existing apt) | 60,000–200,000 (often impractical) |
| Earthquake retrofit (general structural strengthening) | 100,000–500,000+ |
| Energy retrofit | 50,000–250,000 |
| Building inspection (independent בדיקה) | 1,500–4,000 |
| **Total transaction cost (foreign buyer side)** | ~10–13% of price (driven by Mas Rechisha + attorney + broker + VAT on services) |

## Active fiscal incentives (2026)

- **Olim 7-year purchase-tax discount** (Section 12) — see Foreign-buyer section above
- **Olim Arnona discount** — up to 90% in first year, decreasing in years 2–4 (verify per municipality)
- **Misrad HaKlita / Aliyah grants** — `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_aliyah_and_integration` — financial absorption package for Olim
- **Periphery / Development Zone (אזור פיתוח א'/ב')** — tax incentives for businesses in designated peripheral zones; some affect personal income tax for residents
- **Mas Hachnasa pension contributions** — tax-deductible contributions to קרן השתלמות + קופת גמל
- **TAMA 38 / TAMA 70** — earthquake retrofit programs (developer-financed in exchange for density bonus); homeowner gets seismic upgrade + sometimes additional unit/floor/balcony
- **Energy efficiency grants** — Ministry of Energy grants for solar PV, heat pumps, building envelope upgrades; verify currency at `https://www.gov.il/he/departments/ministry_of_energy`
- **Bituach Leumi grants** — Mavtach LeNaghim (mortgage assistance for olim, large families, etc.)

## Common listing platforms

- **Yad2** — largest aggregator, full Israel coverage
- **Madlan** — Tel Aviv + Gush Dan; combines listings + Tax Authority transaction overlay (gold standard for Tel Aviv comps)
- **OnMap** — map-first, English+Hebrew, foreign-friendly
- **Komo** — Tel Aviv premium/luxury
- **Homeless** — Hebrew-focused
- **WinWin** — broader real estate platform
- **Anglo-List** — English-language, Anglo Olim + foreign-buyer focus
- **Bnei Brith / specific community listings** — for niche religious-community housing (Bnei Brak, Ramat Beit Shemesh, etc.)

## Caveats unique to IL

- **State-land monopoly (~93%)**: most "sales" are technically lease transfers (with or without Heskem Hadash conversion). Always verify Tabu + RMI lease status.
- **JNF restriction litigation**: ongoing legal contestation; non-Jewish buyers face the swap mechanism; watch HCJ rulings.
- **Karnit caps**: war-damage compensation has caps tied to property tax-assessed value, NOT market value — coverage gap can be material on premium properties.
- **Land devaluation NOT compensated**: Otef Aza / Northern border properties may retain Karnit cover for damage but lose 30–60% market value with no compensation pathway.
- **Settlement / Area C / East Jerusalem / Golan deeds**: international-law status disputed; some parcels registered under Jordanian or Ottoman pre-1967 systems; specialist counsel mandatory; foreign-buyer reputational risk consideration (some EU jurisdictions caution against settlement-area transactions).
- **Bedouin unrecognized villages (Negev)**: ~30–50 villages lack formal recognition + infrastructure + Tabu titles — extreme caution.
- **Tabu vs RMI dual system**: parcel must be verified in BOTH; pre-1969 unsettled parcels (`לא מוסדר`) need attorney verification.
- **Unauthorized additions (חריגות בנייה)**: extremely common; sometimes municipality has no current record of as-built; verify against the original heter.
- **VAT 18% on new-build (raised from 17% on 1 January 2025)**: clarify whether listing is gross or net of VAT.
- **TAMA 38 sunset 2022**: existing pipeline projects continue under transitional rules; new earthquake retrofit under local outline plans + TAMA 70.
- **Bituach Leumi (national insurance)**: foreign property owners renting out to Israeli tenants may incur bituach leumi exposure if classified as business activity — verify with Israeli accountant.
- **AML / source-of-funds**: Anti-Money Laundering Order 5761-2000 mandates KYC by attorneys + banks; non-resident buyers should expect comprehensive source-of-funds documentation requests.
- **Wartime emergency tax orders**: temporary purchase-tax + Karnit-funding adjustments since October 2023; verify at signing.

## Quirks to know

- **Tabu vs RMI dual-system**: ~93% of land touches both registers; pre-1969 unsettled parcels are tracked at the older Land Registry under different procedures.
- **Bait Meshutaf (בית משותף — condominium law)**: under Land Law 5729-1969 §52–77; condominium register kept separately at Tabu; building must have a ratified `תקנון` (by-laws) and a `נציגות הבית המשותף` (representative) registered.
- **East Jerusalem / Area C / Golan / settlement-area deeds**: international-law status contested; some parcels registered under Jordanian (pre-1967), Ottoman (pre-1917), British Mandate, or military-administration regimes; specialist counsel mandatory.
- **Bedouin unrecognized villages (Negev)**: ~30–50 villages without formal recognition; no Tabu titles; extreme due diligence.
- **Heskem Hadash eligibility varies parcel-by-parcel**: not all state-leased parcels qualify; verify with RMI before banking on a freehold conversion.
- **Mamad (shelter room) mandatory in new builds since 1992**: verify presence + functional status; older buildings rely on stairwell or public shelters.
- **Energy rating (דירוג אנרגטי) mandatory for new builds since 2017**: verify rating certificate.
- **Asbestos pre-1990 likely**: licensed removal under Asbestos Hazards Prevention Law 5771-2011.
- **Bituach Dira (apartment insurance)**: typically covers structure + contents + earthquake (verify rider); war-damage routes through Karnit instead.
- **Non-resident bank-account opening**: Israeli banks comply with FATCA + CRS; expect detailed source-of-funds documentation; allow weeks for account setup.
- **VAT 18% on services** (effective 1 January 2025): attorney + broker + appraiser fees all subject to VAT.
- **Vacation home / second-home rules**: a property declared as the buyer's "single home" (`דירה יחידה`) gets the discounted Israeli-resident purchase-tax scale — non-residents cannot claim this; foreign buyers always pay the investor scale.

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-05-01.
**Coverage check**: foreign-buyer eligibility, pricing, traffic, tax, rental, work, risks, mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for legal framework (Land Code via Reshumot; RMI structure via gov.il; Karnit via primary statute; Mas Rechisha brackets via Tax Authority — all primary state agencies). MEDIUM for current bracket numerical values (annual indexation 16 January; verify at signing). MEDIUM for war-zone insurability and Otef Aza / Northern-border pricing (active conflict period; data thin). LOW for settlement-area / disputed-jurisdiction deeds (specialist counsel mandatory; not commodity due-diligence).
