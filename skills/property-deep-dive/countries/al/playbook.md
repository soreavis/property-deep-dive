### 2025-2026 price benchmarks (INSTAT + BoA)

| Region | EUR/m² (typical) | YoY |
|---|---:|---:|

- **ARRSH (Autoriteti Rrugor Shqiptar)**: `https://www.arrsh.gov.al/`
- City traffic data Tirana

### Key term

**Trafiku mesatar ditor (TMD)** = AADT-equivalent.

### Verdict bands

- 🟢 < 1,500 v/d (residential, rural)
- 🟡 1,500–10,000 v/d (regional roads, urban side streets)
- 🟠 10,000–35,000 v/d (Tirana arterials, A1 corridor)

### Vlora airport corridor — do NOT model

**Vlora International Airport is not operational**: no commercial flights as of Aug 2026, works suspended amid the Mabco Constructions vs 2A Group shareholder dispute, and MIE was reported 4-5 Aug 2026 to have initiated the procedure to terminate the concession (not published by the ministry; concessionaire Mabco says it received no official notice and warns of international arbitration). The MIE minister expressly refused to name any completion date at his [22 May 2026 press conference](https://www.infrastruktura.gov.al/konference-per-media-e-ministrit-te-infrastruktures-dhe-energjise-enea-karakaci). Treat any opening date as unconfirmed — do **not** band an airport-access corridor at Vlorë, and do **not** price airport proximity into a Vlora / Riviera purchase.

## Section: `--tax`

### Annual property tax — Tatim mbi pasurinë e paluajtshme

- **0.05 % of cadastral / reference value** for **residential** apartments / dwellings (post-2018 reform)
- **0.2 % of cadastral / reference value** for **commercial / business-use** property (post-2018 reform) *(2026-05-27 verified, source Tax-Checker AL + ALTAX + HLB)*
- Cadastral / reference value per m² set by Cadastre Office (ASHK); collected via water bill in most bashki
- Typical Tirana apartment: ~€50–€150/yr est. (very low) — derived from the 0.05 % rate × cadastral/reference value above; verify cadastral value per m² with ASHK
- (The ALL 100–2,000/m² fixed-fee figure belongs under transfer taxes for commercial buildings, NOT this annual tax — see Transaction taxes below)

### Personal income tax (PIT) framework — post-2024 reform (Law 29/2023)

Progressive employment-income brackets, in force from 1 January 2024:

| Annual employment income | Rate |
|---|---:|
| Up to ALL 600,000 (~€5,940) | **0 %** |
| ALL 600,001 – ALL 3,000,000 (~€29,700) | **13 %** |
| Above ALL 3,000,000 | **23 %** |

Flat-rate carve-outs for property-relevant income: **rental 15 %**, **CGT 15 %**, **dividends 8 %**. Cite Law 29/2023 + [tatime.gov.al](https://www.tatime.gov.al/eng/c/4/96/108/tax-on-personal-income). *(2026-05-27 verified, source PwC + tatime.gov.al + Eurofast Tax Card 2025)*

### Transaction taxes

| Tax | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| **Transfer (one-time)** | **2 % of sale price** for individuals | **ALL 100 – ALL 2,000/m²** fixed fee (municipality-set + building-class) |
| **Annual property tax** | 0.05 % cadastral | 0.2 % cadastral |
| **Capital gains (PIT)** | 15 % on profit | 15 % on profit |

- **TVSh (VAT)**: **20 % standard**. **0 % on newly built residential** sold by the developer (zero-rated supply, no VAT for new-apartment buyer). **No VAT on second-hand residential resales between individuals** (only 2 % transfer + 15 % CGT apply). Commercial supplies → 20 % standard *(2026-05-27 verified, source PwC + tatime.gov.al + Folie Village)*
- **Family transfers**: exempt
- **Notary**: sliding scale per Chamber of Notaries tariff — **0.35 %** (€714–€43k) / **0.30 %** (€43k–€107k) / **0.28 %** (€107k–€357k) / **0.25 %** (€357k–€714k) / **0.23 %** (>€714k); plus stamp duty up to ALL 1,000 (~€10). Typical €200 k Tirana apartment → notar fee ~€560 (0.28 %) *(2026-05-27 verified, source Access Albania + Eurofast)*
- **Legalization fees** if title needs regularization (variable)

### One-time property revaluation window (eff. 1 Jan 2026 – 31 Dec 2026)

- **Law 85/2025 "Për rivlerësimin e pasurisë së paluajtshme"** opens a 12-month window during which individuals and businesses may revalue immovable property to market value, paying **5 % tax on the uplift** between previous registered value and new market value
- Finance Minister Malaj clarified the 5 % rate applies specifically to **newly built residential** (verify final regulation before assuming broader scope)
- **Material for any seller carrying a low-historical-cost basis**: revaluing now at 5 % means the future 15 % CGT is computed off the newer (higher) basis *(2026-05-27 verified, source HLB Albania + Balkanweb + RTSH)*

### Total transaction cost (buyer side)

- Resale: ~3-5% (transfer tax + notary + legalization checks)
- New build: 20% VAT in some cases + ~3% other costs
- **Note**: actual rates highly municipality-dependent + legalization-status-dependent

### Property-tax reform timeline (2026-2030)

- **End-2026**: all bashki integrated into Fiscal Cadastre System (mandatory)
- **2026-2027**: transition period for market-based property valuation
- **2027**: nationwide property assessment / valuation
- **2028**: market-based valuations for buildings + tax-rate adjustments + exemptions structure introduced
- **2030**: land-tax rollout via fully integrated EU-model system
- Revenue target: lift property tax from 0.3 % → 1 % of GDP by 2028 *(2026-05-27 verified, source Albanian Times + ALTAX + HLB)*

### Future risk

- **NEW 1 Jan 2026 DIVA platform**: short-term rental income must be declared via Albanian digital tax system (15% flat tax). The Booking.com NIPT / commission-VAT rule is **not** an upcoming change — it has been in force since **1 Nov 2023** (see `--rental` § Short-let)
- **Council of Ministers Decision (VKM) nr. 153, dated 11.3.2026** (Fletorja Zyrtare 2026 nr. 54): approves the **model-type agreement between the National Coastal Agency (Agjencia Kombëtare e Bregdetit) and the investor** for use of sea, lake and river shores as **beach stations** (*stacione plazhi*) — adopted under Art. 100 of the Constitution + Art. 29(2) of Law 55/2015, i.e. a **strategic-investor coastal-concession template, NOT accommodation-structure certification**. Beach-station operating conditions + criteria sit in **VKM 649 dated 16.10.2024**, as amended by **VKM 60 dated 28.1.2026** and **VKM 346 dated 13.5.2026** *(2026-08-07 verified, source AlProfit Consult + `https://qbz.gov.al/eli/fz/2026/54`)*

### Long-term residential

- **Kodi Civil**
- Tenant protection moderate
- Standard 1-3 yr contracts

### Short-let (Airbnb) — MAJOR NEW REFORM 2026

**1 Jan 2026 DIVA platform**:
- Short-term rental income **must be declared via DIVA** (Albanian digital tax system)
- **No NIPT (business tax number) required for individuals** *under DIVA itself* — but a NIPT is separately required by Booking.com (below)
- **15% flat tax** on rental income
- Penalties for underreporting

**Booking.com commission VAT / NIPT — in force since 1 Nov 2023** (not a 2025 or 2026 change):

- Accommodation partners who do not supply an Albanian **Tax ID (NIPT)** plus VAT-registration confirmation, date and attestation are charged **20 % VAT on Booking.com commission invoices**; Booking.com is itself VAT-registered in Albania and remits that VAT in full to the Albanian tax authorities
- Partners supplying **neither** Tax ID nor VAT confirmation additionally **cannot claim the commission as a deductible expense** and **cannot recover input VAT**
- Tax ID obligatory **even for non-VAT-registered hosts**
- No 2025 amendment found; the 2023 terms are still published as current on partner.booking.com *(2026-08-07 verified, source [partner.booking.com Albania VAT commission FAQ](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/compliance/tax-remittance-management/vat-commission-invoices-albania-faqs) + Tiranapost + HLB Albania)*

**VKM 153 dated 11.3.2026 is NOT an STR tourism-licensing rule** (Fletorja Zyrtare 2026 nr. 54): it approves the model-type agreement between the National Coastal Agency (Agjencia Kombëtare e Bregdetit) and the investor for use of sea, lake and river shores as **beach stations** (*stacione plazhi*), under Art. 100 of the Constitution + Art. 29(2) of Law 55/2015 — a strategic-investor coastal-concession template, not accommodation-structure certification. Beach-station operating conditions + criteria sit in **VKM 649 dated 16.10.2024**, as amended by **VKM 60 dated 28.1.2026** and **VKM 346 dated 13.5.2026**. Accommodation-structure classification for short-let hosts is not established by VKM 153/2026 — verify at `https://qbz.gov.al/` *(2026-08-07 verified, source AlProfit Consult + `https://qbz.gov.al/eli/fz/2026/54`)*

## Active fiscal incentives (2025-2026)

- **EU accession sprint**: all 33 negotiating chapters opened by 17 Nov 2025 (Clusters 1-6 in 13 months, EC framing); **8th Accession Conference 26 May 2026** confirmed Cluster 1 interim benchmarks met (IBAR; COELA step 21 May 2026), unlocking chapter closure; **9th Accession Conference 14 Jul 2026 provisionally closed the first 3 chapters** — 25 science and research, 26 education and culture, 30 external relations — with **30 chapters still open (Aug 2026)**; Tirana targets conclusion by **end-2027** and the EC 2025 Enlargement Communication judges it "on track" subject to reform pace. **Membership-year talk (2029-2030) is aspirational — no EU-side accession date is fixed**; model a 5-10-yr exit accordingly *(2026-08-07 verified, source Consilium + European Western Balkans + Balkan Insight + [EC news 14 Jul 2026](https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/enlargement-albania-and-eu-provisionally-close-negotiations-science-and-research-education-and-2026-07-14_en))*
- **EU pre-accession funding** for energy retrofit + infrastructure
- **Vlora International Airport — NOT OPERATIONAL, concession may be terminated**: no commercial flights as of **Aug 2026**; works **suspended** amid the **Mabco Constructions vs 2A Group** shareholder dispute. MIE Minister Enea Karakaçi, [press conference 22 May 2026](https://www.infrastruktura.gov.al/konference-per-media-e-ministrit-te-infrastruktures-dhe-energjise-enea-karakaci) (primary): the airport is not yet operational; contract clauses trigger **penalties first**, then a mitigation plan leading either to **extension of the concession deadline** or to **unilateral termination of the concession contract** — and he expressly refused to name any completion date. Albanian media (Top Channel, Shqiptarja/Report Tv, ABC News, Gazeta Shqiptare, Balkanweb) reported **4-5 Aug 2026**, citing MIE confirmation to journalists, that the ministry has **initiated the procedure to terminate the concession** — not published on the ministry website as of 2026-08-07; Mabco says it received no official notice and warns of **international arbitration** against Albania. **Treat any opening date as unconfirmed and do NOT price airport proximity into a Vlora / Riviera purchase** — verify at infrastruktura.gov.al and aac.gov.al. The 2024-2025 Sarandë/Vlorë +25–58 % YoY surge already booked the anticipation effect; there is no confirmed opening to back further upside *(2026-08-07 verified, source SeeNews + Albanian Daily News + CAPA + Two Continents + infrastruktura.gov.al)*

## Caveats unique to AL

- **Title legalization risk CRITICAL**: many properties built without permits 1990-2010s
- **Buyer must verify legalization status** — do not assume valid title
- **2021-2024**: 347 de-legalization decisions in Tirana, **656 nationally**
- **Legalization narrowing not expanding** (protected areas, coastline buffers, public land **no longer eligible**)
- **NEW 1 Jan 2026 DIVA platform**: STR income mandatory declaration + 15% flat tax
- **Vlora International Airport — NOT OPERATIONAL** (no commercial flights as of Aug 2026; works suspended, Mabco Constructions vs 2A Group shareholder dispute; MIE minister refused to name any completion date at his 22 May 2026 press conference; MIE reported 4-5 Aug 2026 to have initiated the concession-termination procedure — unpublished by the ministry, Mabco warns of international arbitration). **No opening date is confirmed — do NOT price airport proximity into a Vlora / Riviera purchase**; verify at infrastruktura.gov.al and aac.gov.al — see Active fiscal incentives
- **iKadaster fully digital cadastre** target end of 2026 (World Bank program)
- **2019 Durrës M6.4 earthquake**: €985m losses (~7.5% of 2018 GDP); residential damage extensive
- **Vore fault near Tirana** — future seismic hazard flagged
- **Tirana Bllok premium** (former Communist Party district = trendy upscale)
- **Adriatic coast booming** (Sarandë +25-58% YoY) — speculative
- **Currency ALL** — **floating** (BoA inflation-targeting); 2023-2025 range EUR/ALL ~98–110 with secular ALL appreciation (`leku i fortë`). 5–15 % FX volatility vs EUR realistic. Buyer carries FX risk if income is in EUR. (NOT pegged.)
- **Foreign-buyer rules — Ligji 7980/1995 "Për shitblerjen e trojeve"** *(2026-05-27 verified, source Investropa + Vivaview + Alba Legal)*:
  - **Apartments / houses / commercial buildings**: foreigners own outright, identical rights to Albanian citizens
  - **Agricultural land**: prohibited for direct foreign ownership; workaround = Albanian Sh.p.k. company (€500-1,000 setup, ~2 weeks) OR long-term lease (up to 99 years)
  - **Construction land** (urban building plots): only purchasable when linked to a building investment whose value is **at least 3× the land value** ("3x rule" per Ligji 7980)
  - **Coastal land within 200 m of Adriatic/Ionian shoreline**: special restrictions; foreign buyer typically uses SPV / Albanian company
- **EU accession sprint** — all 33 chapters opened by 17 Nov 2025; Cluster 1 interim benchmarks (IBAR) confirmed at the 8th Accession Conference 26 May 2026 (COELA step 21 May 2026); **first 3 chapters provisionally closed 14 Jul 2026** (25 science and research, 26 education and culture, 30 external relations), **30 still open (Aug 2026)**; Tirana targets conclusion by end-2027 — but membership-year talk (2029-2030) is aspirational, **no EU-side accession date fixed** *(2026-08-07 verified, source Consilium + European Western Balkans + Balkan Insight + EC news 14 Jul 2026)*
- **Family transfers exempt** from transfer tax
