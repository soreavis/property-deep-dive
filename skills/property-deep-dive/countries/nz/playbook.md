## Section: `--price`

### Primary sources

- **REINZ (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) HPI**: `https://www.reinz.co.nz/Web/Web/Data-and-Products/REINZ-HPI-Report.aspx` — monthly, authoritative
- **Quotable Value (QV) / Cotality NZ**: `https://www.qv.co.nz/price-index/` — local government valuation; rates basis
- **Stats NZ**: `https://www.stats.govt.nz/` — house price + rental indices
- **OneRoof Property Report**: `https://www.oneroof.co.nz/` (NZ Herald)

### Listing platforms

- **Trade Me Property**: `https://www.trademe.co.nz/property` — ~39k listings
- **realestate.co.nz**: `https://www.realestate.co.nz` — industry-owned, ~35k listings
- **OneRoof** (NZ Herald) — secondary
- **Homes.co.nz** — sold-price specialty

### 2026 price benchmarks (REINZ + QV March 2026)

| Region | Median (NZD) | YoY |
|---|---:|---:|
| **National median** | $788,000 | 0.0% (HPI) |
| **Auckland (Tāmaki Makaurau)** | $1,040,000 | -1.1% |
| **Wellington City** | $908,000 (avg QV) | **-5.1%** (hit hardest) |
| **Christchurch (Ōtautahi)** | $735,000 | record |
| **Canterbury HPI** | — | +3.2% |
| **Hamilton** | $755,000 | -1.0% |
| **Tauranga** | $880,000 | +0.5% |
| **Dunedin** | $625,000 | -2.0% |
| **Queenstown Lakes** | $1,500,000+ | +2.0% |

### Compute

1. NZD/sqm = price / **floor area** (sqm dominant unit)
2. Cross-check **REINZ HPI** + **QV** + **Trade Me sold-price**
3. **HPI vs median**: HPI strips luxury/distressed; median runs 5-10% higher
4. **Wellington -25.88%** from Oct 2021 peak (worst-affected city)
5. **Convert NZD to EUR/USD** at current FX

### Key terms

- RT (Record of Title) = land title
- Cross-lease = shared title with flat plan (Auckland-specific quirk)
- Body Corporate = HOA for unit title
- LIM = Land Information Memorandum (council report)
- Bright-line = capital gains test

---

## Section: `--traffic`

### Sources

- **NZTA (Waka Kotahi) Traffic Counts**: `https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/state-highway-traffic-volumes`
- **AADT data + heavy-vehicle proportion** by road
- **Council traffic data** for local roads

### Key term

**AADT** — same as US/UK.

### Verdict bands

- 🟢 < 1,000 v/d (residential, rural)
- 🟡 1,000–8,000 v/d (suburban arterial)
- 🟠 8,000–25,000 v/d (urban arterial, SH-routes)
- 🔴 > 25,000 v/d (motorways: SH1, SH16, SH20)

---

## Section: `--tax`

### Annual property tax — Council Rates

Rates = **general rate × Capital Value (CV) or Land Value (LV)** + targeted rates.

**No central property tax** — rates are local-authority-only.

| City | Annual rates (typical) |
|---|---:|
| Auckland Council | ~0.30% of CV (median ~$3,500) |
| Wellington | ~0.65% of CV (median ~$4,500) |
| Christchurch | ~0.60% (median ~$3,800) |
| Queenstown Lakes | ~0.45% (median ~$5,500) |

**Rates frozen** in some councils 2024-2025 due to crisis politics.

### Transaction taxes

- **NO STAMP DUTY** (abolished 1999) — UNIQUE in OECD
- Legal fees: $1,500–$3,000
- LIM report: $300–$500
- Building report: $500–$1,000

### Capital gains tax — BRIGHT-LINE TEST

**No general CGT in NZ.** But the **bright-line test** taxes residential property gains as ordinary income IF sold within the bright-line period:

| Bright-line period | When applicable |
|---|---|
| **2 years** | From 1 Jul 2024 (current; was 5/10) |
| 5 years | 27 Mar 2018 – 28 Mar 2021 |
| 10 years | 27 Mar 2021 – 30 Jun 2024 |
| 2 years | Pre-27 Mar 2018 |

- "Bright-line start date" varies (settlement, contract date)
- Main home exemption applies but tightened
- Inheritance + relationship transfers exempt

### GST

- **15%** on new builds; resale exempt
- From **1 Apr 2024**: GST collected by online STR marketplaces (8.5% passed to non-GST-registered hosts)

### Interest deductibility (BTL)

**Fully restored 100% from 1 Apr 2025** (tax year ending 31 Mar 2026 onwards) — major reversal of 2021 phase-out.

### Foreign-buyer regime

**Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018** — foreign nationals **cannot buy** existing residential property except:
- AU + SG resident citizens (treaty exemption)
- Existing residence permit holders
- New builds + apartments off-the-plan (with conditions)

### Total transaction cost (buyer side)

- Resale primary: ~$3,000–$5,000 fixed (legal + searches + LIM) — **lowest in OECD**
- New build with GST: 15% + ~$3,000 fees

### Future risk

- Bright-line expansion possible if government changes
- Foreign-buyer ban likely to remain
- Interest deductibility could be re-tightened

---

- BTL interest fully deductible (from 1 Apr 2025)
- Bright-line test on sale
- **GST $60k threshold** (online STR platforms collect for non-registered hosts)

## Caveats unique to NZ

- **NO STAMP DUTY** (abolished 1999) — UNIQUE in OECD; transaction cost ~$3-5k
- **NO general CGT** but **bright-line test 2 years** (from 1 Jul 2024) — sells within 2 years = ordinary income
- **Foreign-buyer ban (2018)** — AU + SG resident citizens exempt; new builds partly exempt
- **NHCover (Toka Tū Ake)**: mandatory $300k+GST natural-disaster insurance via property insurance — UNIQUE coverage
- **Earthquake risk extreme** — NSHM 2022 raised hazard ~50%; Christchurch + Wellington high
- **Wellington -25.88%** from Oct 2021 peak (hit hardest by recent rate cycle)
- **Cross-lease titles** (~10% Auckland) — shared ownership of section, flat plan; clunky for renovations
- **Leaky homes crisis** (1990s-early 2000s) — monolithic cladding pre-2003 vulnerable
- **Healthy Homes Standards** mandatory for rentals
- **Interest deductibility 100% restored 1 Apr 2025** for residential investment
- **GST on STR via platforms** since 1 Apr 2024
- **Cyclone Gabrielle 2023** + Auckland floods 2023 — major recent reform drivers
- **NHCover building cap $300k+GST** — high-value houses need top-up insurance
- **LIM report ~$300-500** mandatory in practice
- **Māori land** (Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993) — unique constraints, often 99-year leases
- **Rating valuations** (CV/LV) every 3 years per council; not market value
- **Rental loss ring-fencing** — cannot offset other income

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-04-25.
**Coverage check**: pricing (REINZ HPI + QV + Trade Me), traffic, tax (rates + bright-line + GST + zero stamp duty), rental (RTA + Healthy Homes), work, risks (NSHM 2022 + Cyclone Gabrielle 2023 + leaky homes), mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for REINZ + QV March 2026 medians + bright-line 2-yr from 1 Jul 2024 + interest deductibility 100% from 1 Apr 2025 + foreign-buyer ban (AU+SG exempt) + NHCover $300k+GST cap + STR GST collection from 1 Apr 2024; MEDIUM for council rate forecasts (frozen in some councils 2024-2025).
