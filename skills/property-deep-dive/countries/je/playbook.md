# Jersey 🇯🇪 — Property Due-Diligence Playbook

ISO2: `je`. Status: ✅ Initial populated (Crown Dependency, standalone playbook).

> **Crown Dependency notice.** Jersey is a self-governing Crown Dependency — **NOT** part of the United Kingdom and **NOT** in the EU/EEA. Jersey has its own Parliament (States Assembly), tax authority (Comptroller of Revenue), financial regulator (Jersey Financial Services Commission — JFSC), legal system (Royal Court of Jersey, French civil-law roots), and land registry (Public Registry of Contracts, held by the Judicial Greffe). UK Stamp Duty Land Tax, UK Land Registry rules, UK leasehold reform, English conveyancing, and HMRC tax rules **DO NOT apply**. Anyone advising on a Jersey purchase using UK rulebooks is wrong by default.

## Country profile

- ISO code: `je` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
- Postcode pattern: `JE1`–`JE5` (UK-style outward code, but Jersey-only)
- Currency: Pound sterling (£) — Jersey issues its own notes/coins via the States of Jersey, at parity with GBP
- Language: English (legal documents historically passed in French in the Royal Court; modern conveyances are dual-language)
- Population: ~103,000 (2021 Census, [gov.je](https://www.gov.je/Government/Census/Pages/index.aspx))
- Area: 119 km² (12 parishes)
- Cadastre / land registry: **No public-search cadastre comparable to French `cadastre.gouv.fr`** — title is held in the Public Registry of Contracts at the Royal Court / Judicial Greffe ([courts.je/judicial-greffe/public-registry](https://www.courts.je/judicial-greffe/public-registry/)). Records dating from 1602; mandatory registration of `partages` since 1840 (per Public Registry records).
- Time zone: Europe/Jersey (UTC+0 / +1 BST — matches UK)

## Section: `--foreign-buyer` (CRITICAL — read first)

**Jersey is a closed housing market.** Unlike the UK, anyone (citizen, foreigner, even UK national) needs the right **residential status** under the **Control of Housing and Work (Jersey) Law 2012** ([jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_31_2012](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_31_2012)) before they can purchase or rent most homes. UK citizenship alone does **not** confer rights to buy.

### The four residential statuses

Source: [gov.je — Residential and employment statuses](https://www.gov.je/Working/Contributions/RegistrationCards/pages/residentialstatus.aspx) (verified 2026-05-27)

| Status | Qualifying condition | Housing rights | Work rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Entitled** | Born in Jersey AND lived ≥10 yrs; OR ≥10 yrs continuous residence (full Entitled clock — see callout below) | Buy / sell / lease ANY property (Qualified or Registered) | Work anywhere without employer permission |
| **Licensed** | "Essential employee" granted by Population Office on employer application | Buy / sell / lease most Qualified property (lose status → lose right to retain) | Employer requires permission; lose job → 3-mo grace |
| **Entitled for work only** | ≥5 yrs continuous residence; OR married/partnered to Entitled/Licensed/Entitled-for-work spouse | Lease Registered property only; can JOINTLY buy with Entitled/Licensed spouse | Work anywhere |
| **Registered** | All others (e.g., new arrivals) | Lease Registered (formerly "Unqualified") property only — no purchase right | Employer needs permission |

> **Reddit signal — the 10-year clock is the dominant community pain point.** Across r/Jersey threads 2023–2025, the single most-cited barrier for non-status buyers is the **10-year continuous-residence clock to full Entitled status** (which unlocks freehold purchase). The 5-year "Entitled for work" milestone gives lease rights + joint-purchase with a status spouse, but **solo freehold purchase requires 10 years' residence** (or HVR consent). UK readers arriving expecting Common-Travel-Area equivalence consistently misread this — flag in any buyer brief.

### The two-tier housing market: Qualified vs Registered

- **Qualified housing** (classifications A-H, A-J, A-K): available for purchase or lease ONLY to Entitled or Licensed persons. This is the bulk of Jersey's freehold stock.
- **Registered housing** (formerly "Unqualified"): older lodging-house stock + a small number of dedicated rental units; available for lease to anyone holding a residential status.

**Practical consequence**: a UK national arriving today, with no prior Jersey residence, can lease Registered-classification accommodation only — typically room-rentals or HMO-style — and cannot purchase ANY residential property unless they secure HVR (`2(1)(e)`) consent or build 5 years toward "Entitled for work" via continuous residence (and 10 years to full Entitled / solo freehold). Sources: [gov.je housing-laws hub](https://www.gov.je/Home/RentingBuying/HousingLaws/Pages/index.aspx), verified 2026-05-27.

### High-Value Resident (HVR) — Article 2(1)(e) consent

The fast track for wealthy foreign buyers. Granted by the Chief Minister on Locate Jersey recommendation; numerically restricted (~20 approvals/yr, per Locate Jersey statements — **not currently statutorily capped**, but see PENDING reform below). Source: [gov.je — High Value Residency](https://www.gov.je/Home/RentingBuying/HousingLaws/pages/highvalueresidency.aspx) (verified 2026-05-27).

> **PENDING legislative proposal — P.19/2026.** Deputy Renouf's proposition (lodged 2026) seeks to **statutorily cap HVR approvals at 15/year (75 over any 5-yr period)** — not yet adopted; awaiting States Assembly vote. Source: [statesassembly.je P.19/2026](https://statesassembly.je/) — `verify current legislative status at statesassembly.je`. Pre-vote, the regime remains administratively-capped only.

**Property thresholds (post-14 Jul 2023 regime):**

- Houses: must purchase a property valued at **more than £3.5 million** *(per prior gov.je snapshot — `verify directly with Locate Jersey; gov.je HVR page does not currently expose £ figures in the live page text`)*
- Apartments: must purchase a property valued at **more than £1.75 million** *(same verify-direct caveat — aggregator immigrantinvest.com cites a single £1.75 m floor; threshold split may have been simplified, confirm before pitching)*
- Property must be the **principal place of residence**

> **Reddit signal — short-let conversion conflicts with HVR consent.** An r/Jersey 2024 HVR thread surfaced an HNWI contemplating converting an annex into 8–10 Airbnb units via a Jersey company. Community correctly flagged that **HVR consent is conditional on the property being the principal place of residence — commercial short-let conversion will jeopardise consent.** Pair this with the Tourism (Jersey) Law 1948 registration requirement (see `--rental`).

**Tax obligation (post-14 Jul 2023):**

- **Minimum annual tax contribution: £250,000** under Article 135A of the Income Tax (Jersey) Law (verified at [gov.je — High value resident tax information](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/IncomeTax/Technical/Guidelines/pages/taxinformationhighvalueresidents.aspx))
- Tax computation: 20 % on the first **£1.25 million** of non-Jersey income, 1 % above that. Jersey land/property income taxed at 20 % flat
- Deemed-income provision: if combined income falls below £1.25 m, additional deemed income is imputed to meet the £250 k minimum
- Annual worldwide earnings expected "well above £1.25 m" (per Locate Jersey)
- Demonstrated economic / social contribution required (philanthropy, voluntary work, business diversification, etc.)
- **2026 reform — mandatory independent taxation for married couples**: from year of assessment 2026, **independent taxation is mandatory for all married couples and civil partners** in Jersey — **including HVRs** (gov.je HVR tax page, verified 2026-05-27). Each spouse files separately; the £250 k minimum applies to the HVR-status holder.

**Pre-2023 HVRs**: those granted consent pre-14 Jul 2023 retain their original regime (minimum tax £145 k, raised to £170 k from 2023) unless they elect the new regime. Pre-2018 consents have separate transitional terms. `Verify the precise transitional figures directly at gov.je HVR tax page — historic numbers not exposed via current page extract.` (Source: [gov.je HVR tax information](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/IncomeTax/Technical/Guidelines/pages/taxinformationhighvalueresidents.aspx))

**About 260 families** live in Jersey via HVR/2(1)(e) since the 1970s (per gov.je HVR page; as-of year not exposed via current page extract — verify the current cumulative count at gov.je; programme open).

### Other routes (compressed)

- **Family**: marriage / civil partnership to Entitled person upgrades you to "Entitled for work only" on day 1.
- **Inheritance**: Jersey property may pass by will but the beneficiary's *occupation* still requires status. Non-status heirs can own the asset but cannot live in it without a tenancy / status change.
- **Investment-only ownership** via a Jersey company: shares can be held by non-residents (subject to JFSC and tax). Not a substitute for personal residential status.

**Verdict band** (foreign-buyer-friction):

- 🔴 Without prior status: residential purchase blocked outside HVR
- 🟠 HVR available but high thresholds (£3.5 m houses / £1.75 m apartments — verify-direct; £250 k/yr tax) + PENDING statutory cap P.19/2026
- 🟢 5-yr continuous residence → "Entitled for work" + joint purchase with status spouse; 10-yr → full Entitled / solo freehold

## Section: `--tax`

**Source ranking**: [gov.je TaxesMoney](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/Pages/index.aspx) (Comptroller of Revenue) is the canonical primary; [States Assembly Budget / Government Plan](https://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/Budget%202026%20to%202029.pdf) sets future-year rates.

### Income tax (personal)

- **Standard rate: 20 %** (the famous "Jersey 20 %") — flat, no progressive brackets above the exemption threshold
- **Marginal-relief rate: 26 %** (applied to income above the exemption threshold, capped at the lower of 20 % flat or 26 % on excess) — effective rate "between 0 % and a maximum of 20 %"
- **Exemption thresholds (2025)**: Single £20,700; Married/Civil partnership £33,200
- Second-earner allowance: £8,200; Child allowance: £3,850/child (2025 data, source: [gov.je 2025 tax allowances](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/IncomeTax/Individuals/AllowancesReliefs/pages/2025taxallowances.aspx) — rates may have changed; verify 2026 figures on the same page when published)
- **Mortgage interest relief on a main residence**: max £1,500 — **2025 is the final tax year of the relief; full phase-out from YA 2026** (source: gov.je 2025 tax allowances + BBC News + States Assembly petition response, verified 2026-05-27)
- **2026 reform — mandatory independent taxation**: from year of assessment 2026, **independent taxation is mandatory for all married couples and civil partners** (gov.je). Each spouse files separately; joint elections phased out.

### Property-transaction taxes

Jersey has **two** transaction taxes depending on the structure of the conveyance.

#### Stamp Duty — for freehold and flying-freehold (immovable property)

Paid to the Public Registry / Judicial Greffe when the contract is passed before the Royal Court.

#### Land Transaction Tax (LTT) — for share-transfer property (movable estate)

Paid to the Comptroller of Revenue on the transfer of shares conferring exclusive occupation rights. Same band structure as Stamp Duty (mirroring) so the regime is broadly equivalent.

> **2026 one-year reform — P.93/2025.** The States Assembly's **Draft Finance (2026 Budget) (Jersey) Law 202-** ([statesassembly.je P.93/2025](https://statesassembly.je/)) introduces a **one-year reduction in the higher-rate surcharge on Stamp Duty, LTT and EPTT — from +3 percentage points above the standard rate to +2 percentage points** (BTL / second-home / non-principal-residence purchases for 2026 only). Standard-rate bands unchanged. Verify the legislation's final-adopted text and effective dates at statesassembly.je before relying for closing-cost computation.

**Both regimes use these tiered bands** per [gov.je LTT rates](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/PropertyTransactionTaxes/LandTransaction/pages/landtransactiontaxrates.aspx) (verified 2026-05-27):

| Band (£) | Standard rate (main residence) | Higher rate **2026 only** (+2pp, BTL / 2nd home) | Higher rate **2025 and prior / 2027 onward** (+3pp) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0–50,000 | 0.5 % (min £10) | 2.5 % (min £10) | 3.5 % (min £10) |
| 50,000–300,000 | 1.5 % | 3.5 % | 4.5 % |
| 300,000–500,000 | 2 % | 4 % | 5 % |
| 500,000–700,000 | 3 % | 5 % | 6 % |
| 700,000–1,000,000 | **3 %** *(corrected — draft erratum)* | 5 % | 6 % |
| 1,000,000–1,500,000 | 4.5 % | 6.5 % | 7.5 % |
| 1,500,000–2,000,000 | 5.5 % | 7.5 % | 8.5 % |
| 2,000,000–3,000,000 | 7.5 % | 9.5 % | 10.5 % |
| 3,000,000–6,000,000 | 10 % | 12 % | 13 % |
| Over 6,000,000 | 11 % | 13 % | 14 % |

Plus a **flat £90 documentary charge** on every transaction (gov.je LTT page). The "Higher rate 2026 only" column reflects the temporary P.93/2025 reduction; the "+3pp" column reflects the standing regime that resumes from 2027 (assuming P.93/2025 is enacted as a one-year measure). Date stamp: rates verified on gov.je as currently published 2026-05-27.

#### First-time-buyer relief

| Band (£) | FTB rate |
|---|---:|
| 0–350,000 | 0 % |
| 350,000–600,000 | 1 % |
| 600,000–700,000 | Sliding scale |
| Over 700,000 | Ineligible (revert to standard) |

(Source: gov.je LTT rates page, verified 2026-05-27.)

#### Enveloped Property Transaction Tax (EPTT)

Where a residential property is acquired via the transfer of an entity (most commonly a Jersey company), EPTT applies at the same rate as Stamp Duty/LTT — closing the "wrap into a company to avoid SD" loophole. **EPTT higher-rate column is subject to the same 2026 +2pp / +3pp framing above.** See [gov.je EPTT factsheet](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/PropertyTransactionTaxes/EnvelopedPropertyTransactionTax/Pages/FactSheet.aspx).

### Recurring property taxes

- **Parish rates** (Foncier rate + Occupier rate) — set annually by each of the 12 parishes (St Helier, St Saviour, St Clement, Grouville, St Brelade, St John, St Lawrence, St Martin, St Mary, St Ouen, St Peter, Trinity) at the parish assembly. **Liability snapshot is 1 January** — owner/occupier at that date pays for the whole rate year, regardless of mid-year transfer (per [gov.je Parish and islandwide rates](https://www.gov.je/Home/Parish/pages/rates.aspx)). Foncier is owner-paid on the rateable value of the immovable estate; Occupier is paid by the resident. Each parish gazettes its annual rates list (see [gov.je gazette St Helier rates list](https://www.gov.je/gazette/pages/sthelierrates.aspx)). Typical combined household burden for mid-market homes: `data not centrally published in a single table — verify with the parish secretariat`. Failure to return an owner declaration → up to £1,000 fine.
- **Islandwide rate**: levied centrally on top of parish rates ([gov.je Parish and islandwide rates](https://www.gov.je/Home/Parish/pages/rates.aspx)) — `exact 2026 multiplier verify at gov.je`
- **No annual council tax / no domestic rates revaluation cycle comparable to England's banding**

### What Jersey does NOT have (the key advantages)

- ❌ **No Capital Gains Tax** (no general CGT on property gains — verify at [gov.je TaxesMoney](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/Pages/index.aspx))
- ❌ **No Inheritance Tax** (no IHT on death). Probate-related stamp duty IS charged under the **Stamp Duties and Fees (Jersey) Law 1998** ([jerseylaw.je 24.960](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/Pages/24.960.aspx)) — applied to the net value of personal (movable) estate. For Jersey-domiciled decedents: worldwide movable estate; for non-domiciled: only Jersey-situs movable estate. Small-estate threshold: gross worldwide estate ≤ £30,000 → no Jersey Grant required (per [courts.je Probate Registry services](https://www.courts.je/judicial-greffe/probate-and-protection/probate-registry/probate-registry-services-and-fees/)). Current band-by-band duty schedule revised 28 Apr 2025 — `verify the current rate table on courts.je Probate Registry services page`. Note: this is a Grant-of-Probate fee structure, not an inheritance tax on heirs.
- ❌ **No general wealth tax**
- ❌ **No annual mansion tax**
- ✅ **GST (Goods & Services Tax): 5 %** flat (sales-tax equivalent; applies to services, not directly to property transactions). Source: [gov.je GST](https://www.gov.je/TaxesMoney/GST/GSTCustomers/pages/gstquickguide.aspx)

This is the structural reason Jersey is a destination for HNW relocation — combined with the 20 % flat income tax — not a low cost of buying (transaction taxes are non-trivial).

## Section: `--land-registry`

### How title is held and proven

- **Public Registry of Contracts** at the **Judicial Greffe, Royal Court House, Royal Square, St Helier JE1 1JG** ([courts.je/judicial-greffe/public-registry](https://www.courts.je/judicial-greffe/public-registry/))
- Records of property contracts since 1602; **mandatory registration of `partages` (property-division deeds) since 1840** (source: gov.je Public Registry records page)
- **Title is NOT a registered title** in the English Land Registry sense. There is no equivalent of HMLR's "title guarantee." Instead, a chain of deeds (`titres`) is read back through prior conveyances. The Public Registry does **not** issue a certificate of title (per gov.je): legal responsibility for verifying good title rests with the buyer's advocate/solicitor of the Royal Court
- DIY conveyance is effectively impossible — only advocates or solicitors of the Royal Court can present contracts for passing (per gov.je Public Registry page)

### The Friday afternoon contract-passing ceremony

- **All immovable-property contracts pass before the Royal Court on Friday afternoons** (verify with Judicial Greffe directly — no other day). Both buyer and seller must be present in person OR represented under a formal power of attorney signed before a `notaire public`. Title transfers at the moment of passing, not on payment.
- Contracts are read aloud in court (historically in French; modern contracts dual-language English/French — the French version often prevails on the most technical clauses)
- After passing, the contract is recorded in the Public Registry — this is the public-notice step

### `Hypothèque` vs charge (the security regime)

- Jersey retains the French civil-law concept of **`hypothèque`** — three types: `judiciaire` (court-imposed), `conventionnelle` (lender-imposed by contract), and **`hypothèque légale simple`** (statutory). `Hypothèques` are recorded in a separate `Hypothèque` register held at the Royal Court
- **`Charges Bancaires`** — bank security over share-transfer property; recorded separately
- A property purchase requires the seller's solicitor to demonstrate all prior `hypothèques` are released (`mainlevée`) before contract passing

### Fees

Public Registry recording fees and stamp duty (above) collected on the day of passing. Fee schedule: [gov.je Public Registry services and fees](https://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/JudicialGreffe/Sections/PublicRegistry/pages/registryservices.aspx). `Verify the current schedule at the gov.je registry-services page — fees are revised periodically`.

---

## Section: `--property-types`

Four core ownership forms. The legal mechanism is **materially different** from England/Wales — leasehold-style apartment ownership barely exists; instead Jersey has share transfer and flying freehold.

### 1. Freehold (full immovable title)

Standalone houses, plots. Pure freehold — title is registered in the Public Registry. Same as freehold conceptually but the conveyance mechanism (Friday Royal Court) is Jersey-specific.

### 2. Flying freehold (post-1991)

Governed by **`Loi (1991) sur la copropriété des immeubles bâtis`** (the "Flying Freehold Law") — drafted specifically to enable apartment-block subdivision (source: [Mourant — Flying Freehold guide](https://www.mourant.com/guides/flying-freehold-property-in-jersey/), [jerseylaw.je](https://www.jerseylaw.je/)). An owner of a flying-freehold unit ("Lot") holds:

- Exclusive ownership of their unit (registered in the Public Registry)
- A percentage interest in the collective ("association") and the underlying land
- Subject to a `Règlement` (rules) and an `Association des Copropriétaires` (residents' management body)

Forms part of the buyer's **immovable estate**. Most post-1991 purpose-built apartments are flying freehold.

### 3. Share transfer (pre-1991, plus some post-1991 by election)

Most pre-1991 apartment blocks (and some newer schemes) use share transfer:

- Freehold of the building is owned by a Jersey company (governed by **`Companies (Jersey) Law 1991`**)
- Buyer acquires **shares** in that company carrying rights to exclusive occupation of a specific unit
- The company's Articles of Association set the unit-allocation rules
- Forms part of the buyer's **movable estate** (legally personal property, not real property) — major consequence for inheritance, `hypothèque`, succession

Transaction tax: **LTT** (not Stamp Duty) — same rates (above).

### 4. Contract lease / ground lease (`bail à long terme`)

Long leases — 9+ years passed before the Royal Court; under-9-year leases are private contracts. Some Crown / Public lands are sold on long leasehold (e.g., 99-year, 150-year). The `Loi (1991)` and `Companies (Jersey) Law 1991` do not displace the older `bail` regime.

### Comparison snapshot

| Feature | Flying Freehold | Share Transfer |
|---|---|---|
| Governing law | `Loi (1991) sur la copropriété` | `Companies (Jersey) Law 1991` |
| Estate type | Immovable | Movable |
| Transaction tax | Stamp Duty | LTT |
| Mortgage security | `Hypothèque conventionnelle` | Charge over shares |
| Friday Royal Court? | Yes | No (share transfer is private) |
| Inheritance regime | Real property succession (`Loi sur la propriété foncière`) | Personal property succession |

## Section: `--rental` (long-let + short-let / Airbnb)

### Long-let licensing — mandatory since 1 Aug 2024

**Public Health and Safety (Rented Dwellings) (Licensing) (Jersey) Regulations 2023** ([jerseylaw.je RO 108/2023](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/ro_108_2023)). All landlords renting out a dwelling require a licence per property; licence attaches to the property (transfers on sale).

- **Application opened**: 1 May 2024 ([gov.je news](https://www.gov.je/News/2024/pages/renteddwelling.aspx))
- **Mandatory from**: 1 August 2024 — operating without a licence is an offence
- Inspection may be required pre-grant; transitional inspection-deferral ran May–Jul 2024

**Minimum standards** — Public Health and Safety (Rented Dwellings — Minimum Standards and Prescribed Hazards) (Jersey) Order 2018:

- **29 prescribed hazards** that the dwelling must remain below threshold on (damp/mould, fire, excess cold, asbestos, lead, structural collapse, etc.)
- **Gas Safe inspection** annually by UK-Gas-Safe-registered engineer
- Smoke alarms (EN14604) on each storey
- CO alarms (EN50291) in every room with combustion (solid fuel, gas)

(Source: [gov.je rented-dwellings licensing toolkit](https://www.gov.je/Home/RentingBuying/OtherRentalOptions/pages/renteddwellings.aspx).)

### Short-let / tourist-accommodation regime

- **`Tourism (Jersey) Law 1948`** + **Tourism Accommodation Regulations** require registration with **Visit Jersey / Economy Department** for short-stay tourist accommodation
- Short-let (Airbnb / Booking.com) — **also captured by the residential statuses regime**: a Registered-status holder cannot operate a short-let business that conflicts with their housing classification. Verify with the Population Office before launching.
- **HVR-specific constraint**: HVR consent is conditional on the property being the **principal place of residence** — commercial short-let conversion (e.g., splitting an annex into multiple Airbnb units) will **jeopardise HVR consent**. Pair the Tourism Law registration check with a `2(1)(e)`-compliance review before pitching short-let strategies to HVR-route buyers.
- No Jersey equivalent (yet) of England's "90-day London Airbnb cap" or France's `Loi Le Meur` thresholds — but the housing-control law effectively constrains foreign-owned BTL.

### Tax treatment of rental income

- Rental income is taxed at **20 %** (standard rate) on the net (after allowable expenses — mortgage interest restricted from 2025 onwards per gov.je guidance; full phase-out from YA 2026)
- Non-resident landlords: liable for Jersey income tax on Jersey-source rental income via the Comptroller of Revenue (`verify exact withholding mechanics at gov.je TaxesMoney/RentalIncome`)

**Compute** (worked example, generic):

- £2,000/mo gross rent × 12 = £24,000 gross
- Less allowable expenses (~30 %, generic est.) = £16,800 net
- Tax: £16,800 × 20 % = £3,360
- Plus parish rates (Occupier rate is tenant's; Foncier is landlord's)
- Net to landlord (pre-mortgage): ~£13,440/yr est. — `verify against actual mortgage interest (relief gone from YA 2026), parish foncier, agent fees (~10–12 %), rented-dwellings licence cost (verify at gov.je)`

---

## Section: `--finance` (banking / mortgage)

### Regulatory authority

- **Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC)** — [jerseyfsc.org](https://www.jerseyfsc.org/) — licenses banks, fund administrators, trust companies. Separate from UK FCA / PRA.

### Major mortgage lenders (consumer market)

Jersey has a small bank-branch retail market, dominated by Channel-Islands-licensed subsidiaries of UK banks (verified via JFSC public register at [jerseyfsc.org](https://www.jerseyfsc.org/)):

- **HSBC Channel Islands**
- **Santander International** (Channel Islands)
- **NatWest International** (RBSI Group)
- **Lloyds Bank International**
- **Skipton International** (Guernsey-headquartered, active Jersey lender)
- **Butterfield Bank (Jersey)**
- **Barclays Jersey**

### Mortgage availability for foreign / non-resident buyers

- **For HVR (`2(1)(e)`) buyers**: full residential mortgages available from all major channel-islands banks, often at competitive rates. Lender-published LTV grids are not generally available; consult an independent Jersey mortgage broker for current cycle.
- **Community-reported non-resident LTV: 50–65 %** *(per multiple r/Jersey + r/HousingUK threads 2023–2024 — anecdotal; Channel Islands banks tightened LTV for non-resident HVR buyers post-2022)*. **Caveat**: prior draft cycles cited 60–75 % off pre-2022 lender literature — current community signal points lower. **Tag as `verify with broker for current cycle — lender-published grids unavailable; community-reported 50–65 % LTV (2023–24)`** before quoting.
- **For Entitled / Licensed residents**: residential mortgages up to 85 % LTV typical; first-time-buyer schemes via Andium (social-housing affiliated) or shared-equity products (`verify current product line at the lender directly`)
- **For non-residents purchasing investment property**: generally restricted by the Control of Housing and Work Law — see `--foreign-buyer` section. Mortgages exist for HVR principal-residence purchases; pure BTL by non-residents is rare.

### Interest-rate environment

- Jersey banks track UK base rate closely (Bank of England). As of 2026-05-27 the BoE base rate is `verify at bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy`. Jersey mortgage rates float over BoE base + lender margin.
- No equivalent of UK 5-yr-fix consumer market depth — most Jersey mortgages are tracker/variable; longer fixes available but pricing wider than UK mainland.

### Currency

- Jersey transactions in £ (sterling). No FX risk for sterling-area buyers.
- For non-sterling buyers (EUR, USD), the Channel Islands banks offer multi-currency accounts; FX is a real cost on cross-border deposit movement.

---

## Section: `--risks`

### Flood risk (most material physical hazard)

- **Coastal flooding** — south coast (St Helier waterfront, La Collette reclamation, Havre des Pas, Gorey) at risk from storm surge + sea-level rise. North coast (St John, Trinity) higher cliffs → much lower coastal exposure.
- **Fluvial flooding** — limited (small island, short watercourses); pluvial / surface-water flooding is the bigger pinch point in St Helier urban core during intense rainfall events
- **Primary source**: [gov.je Flood maps / Strategic Flood Map](https://www.gov.je/Environment/ProtectingEnvironment/CoastalDefences/Pages/index.aspx) and parish-level [Island Plan 2022](https://www.gov.je/Planning/IslandPlanning/Pages/IslandPlan.aspx) — `verify the parcel-level flood overlay at the Planning Department before exchange`
- **Sea-level rise projection (gov.je published)**: ~30 cm by 2050 under mid-range scenarios (assessment year not exposed via current page extract — `verify the source-document year and exact 2026 projection at gov.je environment pages`)

### Coastal erosion

- Recorded retreat at several headlands; not a uniform problem — parish-specific. Check the **Coastal Hazard Map** (Strategic Environmental Assessment 2021–2022) before buying near a cliff edge.

### Seismic

- Jersey lies on a stable craton — **negligible seismic risk** comparable to mainland UK
- No specific building-code seismic provisions

### Subsidence / ground hazards

- Some clay-soil areas in the central / southern parishes — comparable to UK shrink-swell clay claims experience
- Old Jersey Granite quarries (St John, Mont Mado) — verify any historical-mining overlay before buying in those parishes
- Radon: limited published data; granite bedrock makes elevated radon possible in some properties — `verify with a radon test (no central register — UKRadonAct test kit usable; consult Jersey Environmental Health)`

### Build-era hazards (similar to UK / French rural)

- Pre-1949: lead paint likely
- 1950s–1990s: asbestos (artex ceilings, cement flue, AIB) very likely
- 1960s–1980s: cavity-wall insulation may be defective
- 1980s–1990s: timber-frame moisture issues
- Post-2000: modern; check thermal/EPC equivalent

(No Jersey-specific build-era mandatory diagnostic regime equivalent to France's DPE/ERP. Sale-time disclosure depends on contract terms — buyer-beware default.)

### Climate-change adaptation

- Island Plan 2022 ([gov.je Island Plan](https://www.gov.je/Planning/IslandPlanning/Pages/IslandPlan.aspx)) identifies climate as a planning constraint
- Coastal defences (sea wall, slipways) maintained by Infrastructure Department — capacity expected to be increased over the 2025–2040 period

---

## Section: `--mains` (utilities)

- **Water**: [Jersey Water](https://www.jerseywater.je/) — sole public supplier. Charges metered (verify current tariff at jerseywater.je)
- **Electricity**: [Jersey Electricity](https://www.jec.co.uk/) — sole public supplier; imports majority of supply via subsea cables from France (Normandie 1/2/3). Tariffs published quarterly
- **Gas**: [Jersey Gas (Energy Co.)](https://www.jerseygas.com/) — bottled LPG + bulk-mains in St Helier; not universal
- **Sewerage / drainage**: [gov.je — Drainage and sewerage](https://www.gov.je/Home/RentingBuying/BuyersGuide/pages/draindrainage.aspx) — Infrastructure Department. Mains drainage covers most urban parishes; outlying rural properties may have a soakaway / septic system (verify with the seller's pre-contract enquiries and the Planning Department)
- **Broadband**: [JT (Jersey Telecom)](https://www.jtglobal.com/) is the dominant FTTH provider — Jersey is one of the most fibre-penetrated jurisdictions globally (gigabit FTTH widely available since the 2010s)

### Verification path

- Pre-contract enquiries (sent by buyer's advocate to seller's advocate) must include: water connection, drainage type (mains vs septic), electricity supply confirmation, broadband availability, parish rates statement
- For older / outlying properties: site visit + Planning Department search

---

## Section: `--notary` (transaction process)

Jersey's conveyancing process is **closer to French notarial practice than English conveyancing** in form, even though the legal substance is mostly Jersey-customary-law.

### Process steps (typical residential purchase)

1. **Listing and verbal offer** — agent (Jersey Estate Agents Association — JEAA — members typical)
2. **Subject-to-contract** acceptance — informal, not binding
3. **Pre-contract enquiries** — buyer's advocate raises searches with seller's advocate; Public Registry searches commissioned
4. **Draft contract** preparation by seller's advocate; **dual-language** (English/French) for freehold and flying-freehold
5. **Mortgage offer** issued (if required)
6. **Contract exchange** — Jersey does NOT have a clear "exchange of contracts" moment as in England — the binding point is the **Royal Court passing** itself
7. **Friday Royal Court passing** — both parties (or attorneys) attend; contract read; signed; passed
8. **Recording** in Public Registry — title transfers; keys handed
9. **Stamp Duty / LTT** paid on the day of passing
10. **Post-passing**: lender's `hypothèque conventionnelle` (if any) recorded

### No forced heirship in immovable property — but...

- The old "`légitime`" forced-heirship rule on immovable property was **abolished** by the [Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_18_1993). Today, a testator has full freedom of disposition over immovable property.
- **Movable estate** (including share-transfer property) still has *some* forced-heirship protection for surviving spouse + children under the [Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993](https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/l_18_1993) — verify the specific Article applicable to the deceased's estate at the time of death.
- **Cross-border**: EU Succession Regulation (650/2012, "Brussels IV") does **NOT** apply to Jersey (Jersey is not in the EU). Foreign-domiciled buyers should take Jersey + home-jurisdiction succession advice before structuring.

### Advocates and solicitors of the Royal Court

- Only members of the **Law Society of Jersey** ([lawsociety.je](https://www.lawsociety.je/)) can present a contract to the Royal Court
- "Advocate" (rough analogue of barrister-solicitor) and "Solicitor" (English-trained, Jersey-admitted) — both can do conveyancing
- **Typical residential conveyance fee** (2026, est.): £2,500–£6,000 for freehold; £1,500–£3,500 for share transfer — `verify with two quotes; ask for fixed-fee with cost-cap if disbursements unclear`

---

## Section: `--crime` / `--amenities` / `--climate` / `--schools` (inherits from `shared/`)

Jersey-specific anchors for the universal sections:

- **Crime**: [States of Jersey Police](https://www.jersey.police.uk/) — published annual statistical reports. Crime rates are low by European standards; the only meaningful exposure is drug-related (heroin trade with French ports) at the docks. Residential burglary rates roughly comparable to rural UK.
- **Healthcare**: [Health and Community Services (HCS)](https://www.gov.je/Health/Pages/index.aspx) — Jersey General Hospital (St Helier) + smaller community sites. Universal coverage funded by Health Insurance Fund contributions (not a UK-NHS-equivalent free-at-point-of-use system for non-residents). Residents from elsewhere need to register and may face a qualifying period.
- **Schools**: [gov.je Education](https://www.gov.je/Education/Pages/index.aspx) — States-funded primary + secondary schools (free for resident children); fee-paying schools (Victoria College, Jersey College for Girls, Beaulieu, De La Salle) operate selective admissions with means-tested support.
- **Climate**: mild temperate maritime — average winter low ~5 °C, summer high ~20 °C; ~750 mm/yr rainfall, more sunshine hours than most of mainland UK. [Jersey Met](https://www.gov.je/weather/Pages/index.aspx).

---

## Section: `--visa` (cross-link)

Jersey is part of the **Common Travel Area (CTA)** with the UK / Ireland / Isle of Man / Guernsey. EU/EEA nationals lost free-movement rights post-Brexit (Jersey follows UK immigration rules for non-CTA arrivals).

Routes:

- **Common Travel Area** — UK/Irish/Manx/Guernsey citizens enter freely
- **UK work visa (Skilled Worker etc.)** — applies to Jersey but must be combined with **Licensed** status under the Control of Housing and Work Law
- **HVR `2(1)(e)`** — see `--foreign-buyer` (the "investor / wealth migration" route)
- **Jersey Family Reunion / Spouse** — combined CTA + Population Office status grant

See [`shared/visa-programs.md`](../../shared/visa-programs.md) for the cross-jurisdiction comparator table and the ENDED-programs registry.

---

## Section: `--macro` (decision context)

- **Economy**: financial services (~40 % of GVA), professional services, tourism, agriculture (Jersey Royals potatoes, dairy)
- **Public finances**: AAA-rated by S&P (verify current rating at standardandpoors.com)
- **Currency**: GBP — no domestic monetary policy; tracks BoE
- **Demographics**: ageing (median age 41+ per 2021 Census); net migration positive but tightly controlled via the Control of Housing and Work Law
- **Politics**: stable parliamentary democracy; no UK parliamentary representation; defence/external-relations handled by UK under constitutional arrangement
- **Brexit**: Jersey was not in the EU; the EU/EEA-Jersey relationship is governed by the UK-EU TCA (services + financial-services equivalence decisions) — verify post-2026 status at [gov.je/Government/International](https://www.gov.je/Government/International/Pages/index.aspx)

---

## Common listing platforms (Jersey-specific)

- [Jersey Property Bulletin](https://jerseypropertybulletin.com/) — collated agency listings
- [Broadlands](https://www.broadlandsjersey.com/) — agent
- [Le Gallais](https://www.legallais.com/) — agent
- [Maillards](https://www.maillards.com/) — agent
- [Henley Estates](https://www.henleyfinancial.com/) — HVR specialist
- Rightmove / Zoopla — limited Jersey coverage; tag any listing-derived data `(per listing — verify with Public Registry / pre-contract enquiries)`

## Cost benchmarks (Jersey, 2026 est.)

| Work | Cost (£) |
|---|---:|
| Conveyancing — freehold purchase | 2,500–6,000 |
| Conveyancing — share transfer | 1,500–3,500 |
| Pre-purchase building survey | 800–1,800 |
| Stamp Duty on £750k main residence | **£15,590** (standard-rate bands: 250 + 3,750 + 4,000 + 6,000 + 50k×3%=1,500 = 15,500 + £90) |
| Stamp Duty on £1.5m main residence | **£45,590** (standard-rate bands: 15,500 + 300k×3%=9,000 + 500k×4.5%=22,500 = 45,500 + £90) |
| Stamp Duty on £3.5m HVR house (main residence, standard-rate) | **~£198,090 est.** (band-by-band — see worked example below) |
| Rented-dwellings licence application | Verify at gov.je rented-dwellings page |
| Parish rates (mid-market home, combined Foncier+Occupier+Island-wide) | ~£500–£2,500/yr est. (per parish — verify with parish secretariat) |

Worked tax example (HVR principal residence, £3.5 m house) — corrected band-by-band on the **standard-rate column** (P.93/2025 +2pp surcharge does not apply because principal residence):

- £50 k × 0.5 % = £250 (min £10 OK)
- £250 k × 1.5 % = £3,750
- £200 k × 2 % = £4,000
- £200 k × 3 % = £6,000
- £300 k × **3 %** = £9,000 *(corrected from prior 3.5 % erratum — gov.je primary band is 3 % at £700k–£1m)*
- £500 k × 4.5 % = £22,500
- £500 k × 5.5 % = £27,500
- £1,000 k × 7.5 % = £75,000
- £500 k × 10 % = £50,000

Subtotal: £198,000 + £90 documentary = **£198,090** est. — `verify on gov.je LTT ready-reckoner before signing`

## Caveats unique to Jersey

- **Friday-only contract passing** — completion dates are constrained to Fridays; calendar plan accordingly
- **Dual-language contracts** — the French version often controls technical clauses; verify with a bilingual advocate
- **Share-transfer is movable property** — affects mortgage security, succession, and tax structuring vs flying-freehold equivalent
- **The Control of Housing and Work Law is the binding constraint** — Brexit changed nothing about Jersey housing access for UK nationals because Jersey is not in the UK housing system. UK citizenship ≠ Jersey housing rights.
- **10-year clock to full Entitled status** is the dominant non-status-buyer pain point (community-reported across r/Jersey 2023–2025) — not HVR, not the 5-year "Entitled for work" milestone
- **No equivalent of HMLR title guarantee** — your advocate's title-investigation is your only assurance
- **Probate**: separate Probate Registry for movable estate; immovable estate transmits under the `Loi sur la propriété foncière` — both lodged at the Royal Court
- **GST 5 %** applies to many transaction services (legal fees, surveys) — factor into closing costs
- **2026 transient regime** — LTT/SD/EPTT higher-rate surcharge dropped from +3pp to +2pp for 2026 only (P.93/2025); mortgage-interest relief gone from YA 2026; mandatory independent taxation for couples from YA 2026

## Status

✅ **Initial populated** as of 2026-05-27 (Crown Dependency standalone playbook — see `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Sub-sovereign jurisdictions). Patched 2026-05-27 to integrate independent-validation findings.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH — tax / LTT / HVR / residential-status data sourced to gov.je primary pages and verified 2026-05-27. LTT 700k–1m band corrected (3 % standard, not 3.5 % — gov.je primary). 2026 Budget P.93/2025 (+3pp → +2pp higher-rate surcharge), pending HVR statutory cap P.19/2026, and 2026 mandatory independent taxation now integrated. Property-type and Royal-Court process verified against multiple secondary (Mourant, Viberts, Voisin) cross-referenced to jerseylaw.je primaries. **Parish rates**, **rented-dwellings licence fee**, **EPTT current band figures**, **HVR £3.5m/£1.75m thresholds (gov.je page does not expose figures — needs direct Locate Jersey lookup)**, **Voisin 2018 PDF staleness**, and **2026-specific allowance refresh** marked as `verify` placeholders — primary URL given.

**Last verified**: 2026-05-27.

**Open follow-ups** (for next refresh cycle):

1. Confirm 2026 income-tax allowance figures when gov.je publishes the `2026taxallowances.aspx` page
2. Pull parish-specific Foncier + Occupier rate tables from each of the 12 parish secretariats
3. Verify the rented-dwellings licence fee schedule (numeric £, not just the regulation reference)
4. Add specific HVR property-mortgage LTV grids when a direct lender quote becomes available (current draft tags community-reported 50–65 % for non-residents)
5. Add the precise probate-duty rate at [gov.je Probate](https://www.gov.je/) — placeholder currently
6. Verify HVR £3.5 m / £1.75 m thresholds directly with Locate Jersey (gov.je HVR page does not expose £ figures in current page text — aggregator immigrantinvest.com cites a single £1.75 m floor)
7. Track States Assembly P.19/2026 vote outcome (HVR statutory cap 15/yr — currently pending)
8. Confirm Voisin Law brochure currency — current PDF filename dated 2018-11; downgrade or refresh
9. Re-run URL liveness sweep on the ~13 URLs not extracted in the validation pass

**Regulatory-watch entries to seed on PR merge** (none currently exist for JE in [`shared/regulatory-watch.md`](../../shared/regulatory-watch.md) — verified empty 2026-05-27):
