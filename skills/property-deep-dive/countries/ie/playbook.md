## Section: `--mains`

### Sources

- **Uisce Éireann (Irish Water)**: `https://www.water.ie/` — national water utility (since 2014, formerly Irish Water; renamed 2023)
- Local authority sewer/drainage support
- **Group Water Schemes (GWS)** — rural community water supply systems (~7% of population)

### Verification

- Most populated areas: **Uisce Éireann mains** universal
- Rural west coast / Connemara / Mayo / Donegal: often **GWS or own well + septic**
- **Septic Tank Inspection Scheme** since 2013 — registered + inspected
- **DBO concerns** (septic discharge to surface water) — must be compliant under Water Services Acts 2007-2017

## Caveats unique to IE

- **Eircode** (since 2015) — most reliable address identifier; many older systems still use townland+county
- **Tailte Éireann merger 2023** — consolidated Property Registration Authority + Ordnance Survey + PSRA — historic landings under different systems
- **No Irish FHL regime** — short-let classification is per-facts via Revenue Case I (trading) vs Case V (rental) test; DAC7 platform reporting from 2024; Short-Term Letting Register (STLR) opens 1 Dec 2026 (see Short-let section)
- **LPT revaluation 2026-2030** — new bands, base rate 0.0906%, 96% stay in band
- **Pyrite/Mica defective blocks scandal** — Mayo, Donegal, parts of Sligo, Clare, Limerick
  - DCBS up to €420,000 remediation
  - Some properties uninhabitable
  - Engineer survey strongly recommended in affected counties
- **Folio vs Deed registration** — Dublin city often Deed; rest of country Folio. Different processes.
- **Group Water Schemes**: rural water often community-managed (separate from Uisce Éireann)
- **Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)** on inheritance/gifts — important for family transfers
- **Help-to-Buy (HTB)** scheme for first-time buyers (€30k rebate cap)
- **First Home Scheme + LAAP** combined creates complex affordability math
- **Ribbon development restrictions** in many counties (rural one-off houses)
- **An Bord Pleanála** appeals process can stall sales/extensions
- **Storm Éowyn 24 January 2025** as recent reform-driver event
- **No NPPR / Household Charge anymore** — only LPT
- **Rent-a-Room scheme** €14,000/yr tax-free
- **Stamp duty 6% above €1.5M** introduced 2024
- **Bulk-purchase 15% stamp duty** anti-investor measure (10+ residential)

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-04-25.
**Coverage check**: pricing, traffic, tax (LPT 2026 + stamp duty), rental, work, risks (incl. mica/pyrite + Storm Éowyn), mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for LPT 2026-2030 cycle (gov.ie + Revenue.ie + irishtaxhub all confirm 0.0906% rate, 1 Nov 2025 valuation, 20% band widening, 96% stay-in-band); HIGH for stamp duty 6% above €1.5M from 2024; HIGH for DCBS €420k cap. MEDIUM for Storm Éowyn long-term insurance/property pricing impact (still emerging).
