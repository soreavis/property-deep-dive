2. **Antikeimeniki Axia** (Objective Value) — official cadastral assessment, **frozen until 2027**
3. **Cross-check** Bank of Greece RPPI for area trend
4. **Settle objective value vs market**: market often 40-60% above objective

### Key terms

- KAEK = unique cadastral parcel number
- Antikeimeniki Axia = Objective (cadastral) Value
- Apospasma = cadastral excerpt
- Mihaniki Vevaiosi = engineer's statement
- PEA = energy certificate
- Authairesi = unauthorized construction

## Section: `--tax`

### Annual property tax — ENFIA

**Reformed annually since 2014; 2025-2026 reductions**:

#### ENFIA structure

- **Main ENFIA**: per m² × coefficients (location, age, floor, building type)
- **Supplementary ENFIA**: progressive on portfolio total value above €200k (individuals) / €30k (companies)

#### 2025-2026 reductions (CRITICAL)

- **Insured residences ≤ €500k taxable value**: **−20% ENFIA** (since 2025)
- **Insured residences > €500k**: **−10%**
- **Villages ≤ 1,500 inhabitants**: **−50% ENFIA from 2026** (Law 5246/2025; main residence of GR tax residents, taxable value ≤ €400k; excludes Attica except the Islands regional unit; Evros threshold 1,700) — **abolished entirely for these homes from 2027** (announced 89th TIF Sept 2025 — verify gazetting before relying) (2026-07-03 verified)
  - ~12,720 settlements affected
- **Historic buildings ≤ €400k**: exempt
- **Objective values frozen until 2027** — preserves base

#### Illustrative ENFIA bills (est.)

> **est. — not a quote.** Ranges below are modelled from the Main ENFIA per-m² × coefficient structure (line 109) with the 2025-2026 reductions above applied; they are NOT sourced bills. Verify the exact figure on the [AADE myPROPERTY / ENFIA](https://www.aade.gr/) statement for the specific parcel.

| Property type | Illustrative annual ENFIA (est., 2025-2026 basis) |
|---|---:|
| Athens 80 m² apt (€150k objective) | ~€300–€600 |
| Athens villa (€500k objective) | ~€1,500–€3,500 |
| Cyclades vacation home (€350k) | ~€1,000–€2,500 |
| Rural village house (≤1,500 pop) | ~€100–€300 (reflects −50% village cut from 2026, line 116; abolished from 2027 — announced 89th TIF Sept 2025, verify gazetting) |

### Transaction taxes

- **Foros Metavivasis Akinitou (FMA)**: **3% + 0.09% municipal surcharge = 3.09%** on resale (confirmed PwC, multiple 2025-2026 sources)
- **VAT on new builds**: **24% statutory rate**, but **suspended through 31 Dec 2026** (Law 5246/2025, gazetted 11 Nov 2025)
  - During suspension, new builds attract 3.09% transfer tax instead
- **Notary fees**: ~1.0–1.5% sliding scale
- **Lawyer fees**: ~1% (recommended, sometimes mandatory for non-residents)
- **Realtor**: typically ~2% per side (buyer + seller)

### Total transaction cost (buyer side)

- Resale: ~6–8% of price (3.09% transfer + 1-1.5% notary + 1% lawyer + 2% realtor)
- New build (during VAT suspension): same as resale ~6–8%
- New build (post-VAT-suspension): 24% VAT + others

### Capital gains

- **15% statutory rate** (Law 4172/2013)
- **Suspended through 31 Dec 2026** — confirmed
- Caveat: if reclassified as "business activity" (intent, frequency, 3+ properties), normal income tax + VAT apply

### IRS / income tax on rental

- Up to 2 properties: "income from immovable property" (15% / 25% / 35% / 45% bands)
- **3+ properties → business activity** = 13% VAT + hotelier-style obligations (post-Law 5170/2025)

### VAT (FPA)

- 24% standard
- 13% reduced (food, tourist services)
- New residential property: 24% (suspended through 2026)

### Future risk

- **VAT suspension expires 31 Dec 2026** unless extended again
- **Capital gains 15% suspension expires 31 Dec 2026**
- **Antikeimeniki Axia frozen until 2027** — likely revaluation
- **Cadastre full activation 2026** — affects title clarity

## Section: `--rental`

### Long-term residential

- **Civil Code Article 574** governs lease
- Long-term rental (>3 years): notarized strongly recommended
- Tenant moderate protection
- Rent caps in some Athens neighborhoods (proposed 2025-2026)

### Short-let (Airbnb / Vrachychronia Misthosi)

**MAJOR REFORMS 2024-2025**:

#### Athens license freeze

- **From 1 Jan 2025**: NO new STR licenses in **1st, 2nd, 3rd municipal districts of Athens** (Plaka, Syntagma, Monastiraki, Koukaki, Exarchia, Pangrati area)
- Existing licenses keep operating — **two-tier market**: properties without an AMA by 31 Dec 2024 cannot operate STR at all in 2025-2026; pre-2024-12-31 hosts continue
- **Extended through 31 Dec 2026** by Joint Ministerial Decision (Min. Finance / Development / Tourism)
- **Under legal challenge — not settled**: STAMA Greece + a 3rd-district property owner filed a Council of State annulment petition against the extension (Mar 2026); no ruling as of Jul 2026, outcome expected to set nationwide precedent (2026-07-02, news-tier: [eKathimerini](https://www.ekathimerini.com/economy/real-estate/1298502/) + [BnBNews](https://bnbnews.gr/en/legislation/36901/stama-appeal-council-of-state-athens-short-term-rentals))
- **Resale risk — AMA deleted on transfer** (reported effective ~1 Jul 2026; enactment not independently confirmed): in the restricted central zones, **selling / donating / parental-transferring** an AMA-carrying flat deletes its AMA, so the **new owner cannot operate it as an STR** — a "ready-Airbnb" flat's STR right does NOT pass to a buyer. Inheritance treatment **DISPUTED across sources** (26 Jan 2026 ANA report: inheritance also deletes AMA; 23 Jun 2026 Greek City Times: inheritance exempt). Measure contested by POMIDA + STAMA (2026-07-02, news-tier: [Greek City Times 23 Jun 2026](https://greekcitytimes.com/2026/06/23/airbnb-new-rules-greece-july-1-2026-short-term-rentals) + [GTP 15 Jun 2026](https://news.gtp.gr/2026/06/15/greeces-plan-to-remove-short-term-rental-registrations-after-property-transfers-sparks-reactions) + [GTP/ANA 26 Jan 2026](https://news.gtp.gr/2026/01/26/short-term-rentals-in-greece-new-restrictions-take-effect-in-2026))

#### Cyclades / oversaturated regions

- STR freeze announced for **5 additional regions** effective **1 Oct 2025**
- **Cyclades bed caps**: draft Special Spatial Framework for Tourism (JMD) caps NEW tourist accommodation (100 beds/project saturated tier, 350 developed tier) + 25 m coastal no-build; press framed it as "up to 30% fewer beds" (Apr 2026, news-tier — not a figure in the draft text). Draft JMD published 11 May 2026, consultation closed 25.05.2026 (YPEN); ratification was targeted for end-June 2026 — that target has passed and the JMD is **NOT gazetted as of 2026-08-06** (YPEN's own SSFT page still carries only the consultation notice)

#### Law 5170/2025 (effective 1 Oct 2025)

- STR ONLY on properties with **"primary use" status** (not commercial, not basement)
- Mandatory (Law 5170/2025 **Art. 3**, ΦΕΚ Α' 6/20.01.2025, via [Min. Tourism circular 19231/19.09.2025](https://mintour.gov.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/%CE%A86%CE%9B%CE%98465%CE%A7%CE%98%CE%9F-%CE%93%CE%9F7.pdf); 2026-07-02 verified): natural lighting, civil-liability insurance (Greek-licensed insurer), electrician safety declaration, fire extinguisher, smoke detectors, RCD/anti-electrocution relay, escape signage, pest-control + first-aid
- Fines: **€5,000** first breach → **€10,000** on repeat within a year → **€20,000** thereafter (collected under KEDE) (2026-07-02 verified, source [GTP Headlines](https://news.gtp.gr/2025/09/25/greece-introduces-new-rules-for-short-term-rentals-from-october-1/))
- AADE cross-checks **AMA (Property Registration Number)** — non-compliant listings auto-deleted from Airbnb/Booking/Vrbo

#### AMA (Arithmos Mitroou Akiniton)

- Mandatory registration number per property
- Issued by AADE (tax authority)
- Required to advertise on Airbnb/Booking/Vrbo
- **EFKA + AADE cross-checks** since 2023

### Tax on rental

- 1-2 properties: real estate income — **2026 reform** (effective 1 Jan 2026): **15% to €12k / 25% to €24k / 35% to €35k / 45% over €35k** (new €24k tier; pre-2026 was 15/25/35/45 without the €24k break) (2026-05-27 verified, source [Athens Times — 2026 Tax Reform](https://athens-times.com/rental-income-tax-enfia-tax-assumptions-and-benefits-for-uniformed-personnel-tax-bill-passed-what-it-includes/) + [PwC Tax Summaries Greece](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/greece/individual/taxes-on-personal-income))
- 3+ properties: business activity (13% VAT)
- **Income tax credits** for property repairs (up to certain caps)
- **STR statute spine**: L.4446/2016 Art. 111 (AMA registry foundation) → L.4174/2013 Art. 54A (fines) → L.5073/2023 (refinements) → L.5170/2025 (2025 Aegean/Athens regime) (2026-05-27 verified, source [AADE Article 111 of Law 4446/2016 PDF](https://www.aade.gr/sites/default/files/2024-09/Article%20111%20of%20Law%204446_2016%20updated%20by%205073_2023%20-%20relevant%20provisions.pdf))

## Common listing platforms

- **Spitogatos** — biggest

## Caveats unique to GR

- **Ktimatologio** (cadastre) still completing — full activation slipped to 2026
- **Ypothykofylakeio** (legacy mortgage register) for areas not yet operational cadastre
- **Authairesia (unauthorized construction)** widespread — Mihaniki Vevaiosi mandatory; amnesty regimes (L.4014/2011, L.4178/2013, L.4495/2017)
- **Antikeimeniki Axia** ≠ market value (often 40-60% below)
- **Mihaniki Vevaiosi** required for ALL sales since 2011
- **Athens STR license freeze** in central districts since 1 Jan 2025; **extended through 31 Dec 2026** — under Council of State annulment challenge (no ruling as of Jul 2026), and a reported ~1 Jul 2026 rule **deletes a flat's AMA on sale/donation/parental transfer** in the frozen zones (inheritance treatment disputed), so a "ready-Airbnb" resale premium may not pass to the buyer — see `--rental`
- **Cyclades bed caps**: draft **Special Spatial Framework for Tourism** (JMD) puts Mykonos/Santorini et al. in saturated/controlled categories — caps on NEW tourist accommodation (100 beds/project saturated tier, 350 developed tier), 25 m coastal no-build; press framed the package as "up to 30% fewer beds" for the Cyclades (Apr 2026, news-tier — not a number in the draft text). Draft JMD published 11 May 2026, consultation closed 25.05.2026 per YPEN `https://ypen.gov.gr/eidiko-chorotaxiko-plaisio-gia-ton-tourismo/`; ratification was targeted for end-June 2026 — that target has passed and the JMD is **NOT gazetted as of 2026-08-06**. NB the draft's short-term-rental restrictions are not self-executing: the text conditions them on separate legislative/regulatory provision (see `--rental`)
- **Mykonos + Santorini building permit freeze** through 31 Dec 2026 (Special Urban Plans pending)
- **Santorini caldera zone**: no new builds, additions, pools, water infrastructure on Thera/Thirassia
- **Out-of-plan construction** halted in many islands
- **Golden Visa** restructured 1 Sept 2024:
  - **€800k**: Attica (incl. Athens), Thessaloniki, **all Greek islands with registered population >3,100 (including Crete, Rhodes, Corfu, Kos, Mykonos, Santorini, Paros — full list at goldenvisas.gr)** (min 120 m², single unit) (2026-05-27 verified, source [Global Citizen Solutions Greece Golden Visa Map 2025-2026](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/greece-golden-visa-new-rules/))
  - **€400k**: all other regions (min 120 m², single unit)
  - **€250k**: only for heritage-building restoration or commercial-to-residential conversions
  - **STR ban on GV property (post-reform acquisitions)**: residences acquired under the post-Law-5100/2024 Golden Visa regime may NOT be short-let or sub-let — breach → residence-permit revocation + **€50,000** administrative fine on the owners/holders (Law 5100/2024 **Art. 64**, adding para 7A to Art. 100 of Immigration Code Law 5038/2023). Min. Migration **Circular 1/2026 (22 Apr 2026)** narrowed the scope: banned = lettings **<60 days** with no services beyond accommodation + bed linen; long-term leases and hotel-type leases-with-services remain permitted; **properties bought under the pre-Sept-2024 thresholds or in the transitional window are NOT subject to the ban** (statute's "or renewal" wording had suggested otherwise — one advisory source still claims renewals of older permits must comply `(superseded by the circular)`). Circular also refers sham/cash-back GV deals to AADE + the AML Authority. (2026-07-03 verified)
- **VAT 24%** on new builds suspended through 31 Dec 2026
- **Capital gains 15%** suspended through 31 Dec 2026

- **Wildfire risk extreme** May–Oct — evacuation zones critical
- **Tsunami coastal risk** for Hellenic Arc + Aegean
- **3+ properties = business activity** (13% VAT + obligations)
- **EFKA + AADE cross-checks** for short-let income
- **PEA** mandatory since 2010

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-04-25. **Last verified**: 2026-08-06 (SSFT gazetting status re-verified against YPEN; prior Tier-A quarterly refresh 2026-07-03 — fast-moving claims re-verified; structural sections unchanged).
**Coverage check**: pricing, traffic, tax (incl. 2025-2026 ENFIA reforms + VAT/CGT suspensions), rental (incl. STR Law 5170/2025 + Athens freeze + Cyclades draft spatial framework), work, risks (seismic + volcanic + wildfire + tsunami), mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks.
**Confidence**: HIGH for STR reforms (Athens Times, GTP Headlines, ProtoThema, BNB News, Airbnb 2025 Greek tax guide all confirm); HIGH for ENFIA 2025-2026 cuts (multiple tax law firm sources confirm; village abolition from 2027 announced — verify gazetting); HIGH for VAT/CGT suspension extensions through 2026 (Law 5246/2025 gazetted 11 Nov 2025, vatcalc + Elxis confirm); HIGH for Golden Visa restructuring (Global Citizen Solutions + multiple sources confirm 1 Sept 2024 effective) and the GV short-term-rental ban (Law 5100/2024 Art. 64; Varnavas + WFW + IMI Daily + Circular 1/2026 confirm). MEDIUM for Cyclades bed caps (draft Special Spatial Framework — not gazetted as of 2026-08-06, past its own end-June target). MEDIUM for cadastre completion timeline (target slipping repeatedly).
