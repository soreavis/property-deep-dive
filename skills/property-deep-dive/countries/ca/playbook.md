### 2026 price benchmarks (CREA MLS HPI March 2026)

| Region | HPI Composite (CAD) | YoY change |
|---|---:|---:|
| **National composite** | $664,400 | -4.7% |
| **Toronto (TRREB)** | $1,017,796 (avg) | -7.4% |

### Compute

1. CAD/sq ft = price / **square footage** (sqft is dominant unit, not m²)
2. Cross-check **Realtor.ca** sold-price history + Teranet for closed sales
3. **HPI vs average**: HPI strips out luxury/distressed; average runs 5-15% higher
4. **Convert CAD to EUR/USD** at current FX

### Key terms

- PIN/PID/Linc = title identifier per province
- Strata (BC) = condo/townhouse with shared common property
- Co-op = corporate ownership, individual occupancy rights (rare)
- HPI = MLS Home Price Index (CREA)

**FTB rebate**: up to $4,000 ON + $4,475 Toronto.

#### BC Property Transfer Tax (PTT)

- **BC Speculation & Vacancy Tax (SVT)**: **rates DOUBLED for 2026**:
  - Foreign owners + satellite families: **3%** (was 2%)
  - BC residents: **1%** (was 0.5%)
  - Credit raised $2k → $4k

### Capital gains

- Federal: **50% inclusion rate** (2/3 inclusion proposal **CANCELLED 21 Mar 2025** by PM Carney announcement; the $250k/yr threshold was part of the cancelled package and also fell away) (2026-05-27 verified, source: [PM news release](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/21/prime-minister-mark-carney-cancels-proposed-capital-gains-tax-increase))
- Marginal rates: ~25–53% combined federal+provincial
- **Principal residence exemption** — full exemption for years owner-occupied
- **Foreign residents**: lose principal residence exemption from 2026
- **Non-resident disposition — Section 116 clearance**: when a non-resident DISPOSES of Canadian real property, the buyer must withhold **25% of gross proceeds** (50% on depreciable / rental property) until CRA issues a Form T2062 certificate of compliance; CRA processing typically 8-16 weeks; 10-day notice requirement (2026-05-27 verified, source: [CRA IC72-17R6 — Section 116](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic72-17/ic72-17r6-procedures-concerning-disposition-taxable-canadian-property-non-residents-canada-section-116.html))

### Total transaction cost (buyer side)

- ON resale primary: ~3-4% (LTT + legal + title insurance)
- ON resale Toronto >$2M: ~6-8% (tiered LTT + MLTT)
- BC primary <$2M: ~2-3% (PTT + legal)
- BC foreign buyer: ~22-23% (PTT + 20% surcharge)
- AB: <1% (no LTT, just title fee)

### Future risk

- Foreign buyer ban review post-2027 (likely modified)
- BC SVT rates may rise further
- Federal capital-gains inclusion-rate 2/3 proposal **CANCELLED 21 Mar 2025** (no longer in policy pipeline)

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-04-25.
**Coverage check**: pricing (CREA + provincial boards), traffic, tax (extreme provincial divergence), rental (RTA per province), work, risks (wildfire + flood + earthquake + permafrost + radon), mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for CREA HPI Mar 2026 + UHT repeal (Bill C-15 Royal Assent confirmed) + BC SVT 2026 doubling + Toronto MLTT graduated tier (1 Apr 2026) + foreign buyer ban extension; MEDIUM for post-2027 foreign-buyer review (in flux); MEDIUM for capital-gains inclusion rate (2/3 proposal paused).
