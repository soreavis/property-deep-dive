# 中国 / China (Mainland PRC) 🇨🇳 — Property Due-Diligence Playbook

ISO2: `cn`. Status: ✅ Fully populated (researched 2026-05).

> **Scope**: Mainland People's Republic of China only. **Hong Kong SAR** has its own playbook (`countries/hk/playbook.md`); **Macao SAR** has its own playbook (`countries/mo/playbook.md`); **Taiwan (ROC)** has its own playbook (`countries/tw/playbook.md`). Each operates a separate legal, tax, currency, and land-tenure system. This playbook does not cover any of them.

## Country profile

- **Population**: ~1.408 billion (2025 estimate, [National Bureau of Statistics — NBS](https://www.stats.gov.cn/english/)); first sustained natural decline began 2022; UN median projection ~1.39B by 2030
- **GDP per capita**: ~US$13,300 nominal (2024, NBS / IMF); real GDP +5.0 % full-year 2024 (NBS); +4.6–5.0 % 2025 official target
- **Currency**: **CNY / RMB (¥, 人民币)** — managed-float against undisclosed CFETS basket; PBOC publishes daily central parity ([PBOC fixings](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/)); USD/CNY trading band ±2 % around fix; offshore deliverable variant **CNH** trades freely in Hong Kong / Singapore / London. 1 EUR ≈ 7.7–8.0 CNY (Q1–Q2 2026 indicative); 1 USD ≈ 7.1–7.3 CNY
- **Languages**: Standard Mandarin / Putonghua 普通话 (de jure national common language under [国家通用语言文字法 2000](http://www.gov.cn/test/2005-09/12/content_31649.htm) ❌ DEPRECATED — primary source removed; verify with State Council of the People's Republic of China (www.gov.cn)); written **Simplified Chinese (简体)** in mainland use since the 1956–1986 reforms; recognised regional / minority languages (Cantonese 粤语, Wu 吴语, Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian, Zhuang, etc.) coexist locally
- **Postcode**: 6 digits (e.g., Beijing CBD `100020`, Shanghai Pudong Lujiazui `200120`, Shenzhen Futian `518000`); first 2 digits identify the province / municipality
- **Admin levels**: 4 国家直辖市 (province-level municipalities — 北京 Beijing, 上海 Shanghai, 天津 Tianjin, 重庆 Chongqing) + 23 省 (provinces) + 5 自治区 (autonomous regions: 内蒙古 Inner Mongolia, 广西 Guangxi, 西藏 Tibet, 宁夏 Ningxia, 新疆 Xinjiang) + 2 SARs (HK + Macao, separate playbooks). Below province: 地级市 (prefecture-level city) → 区/县/县级市 (district / county / county-level city) → 乡/镇/街道 (township / town / sub-district) → 村/居委会 (village / residential committee)
- **Cadastre**: **自然资源部 (Ministry of Natural Resources, MNR)** — `https://www.mnr.gov.cn/` — operates the **不动产登记 (Real-Estate Unified Registration)** system since 2015 reform; per-property record at the **不动产权证书 (Real-Estate Title Certificate)** level. Day-to-day searches at the **不动产登记中心 (district-level Real-Estate Registration Center)** in person; online lookup via local **政务服务网** portals (e.g., Beijing: `http://zwfw.beijing.gov.cn/`)
  - Pre-2015 legacy paperwork: **房产证 (House Property Certificate)** + **国有土地使用证 (State-Owned Land Use Right Certificate)** — being merged into unified 不动产权证书; verify both still match
- **Identifier**: 不动产单元号 (real-estate unit number) at the parcel + building + unit level; older records carry separate 房屋所有权证 + 土地使用证 numbers
- **Title concept** — **THE CRITICAL POINT**: there is **NO private freehold over land** in the People's Republic of China. All urban land is owned by the **state** ([1982 Constitution Art. 10 § 1](https://www.gov.cn/guoqing/2018-03/22/content_5276318.htm)); all rural / collective land is owned by **village collectives**. Private actors hold a **time-limited 土地使用权 (Land Use Right, LUR)** granted by 出让 (grant / paid transfer) — typical residential term **70 years** (commercial 40, industrial 50). Buildings on top are owned outright; land is leasehold-equivalent
  - **Statutory hierarchy** (2026-05-27 verified, source: NPC database): Constitution Art. 10 (1982) → **土地管理法 (Land Administration Law 1986, last amended 2019)** → **城市房地产管理法 (Urban Real Estate Administration Law 1994, last amended 2019; short form 房地产管理法)** → **民法典 Book II 物权 (Civil Code 2021)** — the latter **absorbed the prior 物权法 (Property Rights Law 2007)**, which is no longer in force as a standalone statute.
  - **Civil Code (民法典) Art. 359 § 1** (effective 2021-01-01): when residential LUR expires, it **shall be automatically renewed**; renewal-fee provisions deferred to "future laws and administrative regulations" — i.e., **the renewal mechanism is statutorily promised but the price is undefined**. Verify: [Civil Code text 中国人大网](http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c30834/202006/75ba6483b8344591abd07917e1d25cc8.shtml); analysis: [Cushman & Wakefield 2024](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/greater-china/insights/blog/navigating-mainland-chinas-land-use-right-renewal-landscape)
  - Commercial / mixed-use 40-year LURs do NOT enjoy automatic renewal under Art. 359; renewal terms negotiated with local government on expiry, with documented precedents requiring a fresh land-grant payment
- **Foreign-buyer rule** — governed by [建设部/商务部/外汇局 171号文 2006 (Opinion No. 171 of 2006)](http://www.mohurd.gov.cn/) plus local-government implementation. Headline regime, post-September 2024 nationwide easing:
  - Foreign individual must **live, work or study in China continuously for ≥ 1 year** to be eligible (residence permit Z / X / Q1 / R-class typically required; tourist L visa not eligible)
  - **One residential property per foreign individual nationwide**, for **own residential use only** — no rental as a foreign-individual landlord under 171号文; in practice rental enforcement varies by city, but the rule is on the books
  - Local overlay in tier-1 cities (post-Sept 2024 easing; verify with the relevant 住建委 — local Housing Bureau):
    - **北京 (Beijing)**: non-Beijing-Hukou residents (incl. foreigners) require **5 consecutive years** of social-security or individual-income-tax payment in Beijing prior to purchase ([北京住建委 2024 update](http://zjw.beijing.gov.cn/)); inside the 5th Ring Road retains stricter limit
    - **上海 (Shanghai)**: from **Sept 2024**, non-Shanghai-Hukou residents require **1 year** continuous social security / individual-income-tax (was 3 years); foreigners follow same rule plus 171号文 1-year residence requirement
    - **深圳 (Shenzhen)**: 3-year social security (was 5; eased Sept 2024); ringfenced by district
    - **广州 (Guangzhou)**: **all home-purchase restrictions abolished Sept 2024** ([CNBC 2024-09-30](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/30/china-property-stocks-rally-after-major-cities-ease-homebuying-restrictions.html)); only the foreign-individual 171号文 1-year rule remains
    - All other Tier-1+/Tier-2/Tier-3 cities: home-purchase restrictions **fully removed** as of late 2024–2025 ([China Index Academy via gov.cn](https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/policywatch/202412/22/content_WS67675cbac6d0868f4e8ee30f.html)) — foreigners still subject to 171号文 1-year rule and one-property-nationwide cap
  - **HK / Macao / Taiwan residents**: treated more favourably than foreign-passport holders under [国发办 2001/12 + 2019 G-B-A 港澳台居民居住证 reforms](http://www.gov.cn/) — broadly equivalent to mainland citizens for residential purchase (no 1-year rule; subject to local Hukou-style rules only)
  - **HK + Macao FX-settlement preferential rule** (formerly HK / Macao residents only) was **rolled out nationwide 15 Sep 2025** (SAFE Notice on Cross-Border Investment Reform; see § `--currency`) — overseas individuals lawfully resident and working in China can settle FX for property purchase based on the contract at the initial stage. Verify against [SAFE 国家外汇管理局 announcements](https://www.safe.gov.cn/en/)
- **Visa**: NO citizenship-by-investment. Property ownership does NOT confer residence rights. Property-relevant pathways:
  - **Z visa / Work Residence Permit (居留许可)** — for employed foreigners; renewed with employer; counts toward 1-year 171号文 residence
  - **X visa** (X1 long-term study, X2 short-term) — student stay; X1 holders eligible for 171号文 1-year rule
  - **Q1 / Q2 / S1 / S2 visas** — family reunion; long-term spouse / dependant of citizens or PRs counts toward 1-year residence
  - **R visa** — high-talent (科技人才 / "Foreign High-End Talent" A-class); fast-tracked; no statutory threshold but minimum salary, qualification, or innovation criteria via [国家外国专家局 / SAFEA / 科技部](http://www.most.gov.cn/)
  - **Permanent Residence (永久居留, "Chinese Green Card", 中国绿卡)** — administered by **国家移民管理局 (NIA, National Immigration Administration)** via `https://www.nia.gov.cn/`; eligibility tracks (investment ≥ US$500K continuous 3 yrs in encouraged sectors; key R&D / talent; family reunion; 4-yr work + tax-payment in China). Total grants since 1985 estimated at < 30,000 individuals through 2024 — extremely selective in absolute terms
  - PR holders: roughly equivalent to citizens for property purchase (no 1-year rule; may purchase multiple properties subject to local restrictions)

### Listing platforms (consumer-facing)

- **贝壳找房 / Beike (Beike Zhaofang)** — `https://www.ke.com/` — KE Holdings; merged 链家 (Lianjia) self-operated brokerage + open-platform agency network; **transaction-data overlay (成交价) via 历史成交查询** is the closest mainland equivalent to a public caveat database; coverage strong in Tier-1 / new Tier-1 cities, thinner in Tier-3/4 *(per listing — verify against 不动产登记中心 records)*
- **链家 / Lianjia** — `https://www.lianjia.com/` — KE Holdings owned-brokerage brand; same data backend as Beike *(per listing — verify)*
- **安居客 / Anjuke** — `https://www.anjuke.com/` — 58.com-owned (now part of 58 Tongcheng); aggregated agency listings *(per listing — verify)*
- **58同城 / 58.com** — `https://www.58.com/` — classifieds; high noise *(per listing — verify; widely flagged for stale and re-posted listings)*
- **房天下 / Fang.com (formerly SouFun)** — `https://www.fang.com/` — long-running portal; new-home developer marketing strong *(per listing — verify)*
- **Q房网 / Q-Fang** — `https://www.qfang.com/` — Shenzhen / Guangzhou strong *(per listing — verify)*
- **我爱我家 / 5i5j** — `https://www.5i5j.com/` — Beijing / Shanghai strong *(per listing — verify)*

> ⚠️ Platform listings in mainland China are seller- / agent-controlled and contain a **non-trivial share of "sham listings"** (假房源) — units no longer for sale, deliberately mispriced for lead generation, or never on market. The 2018 MoHURD crackdown (虚假房源治理) modestly improved data quality on Beike/Lianjia (which back-checks against own-brokerage transaction database), but fewer than 5–10 % of listings on most portals are guaranteed live-and-priced-as-stated. Always cross-check with at least 2 platforms + an in-person agent visit + the registered transaction price (成交价) at 不动产登记中心.

### Tier-1 city benchmarks (Q1–Q2 2026 reference, NBS 70-city index + Beike/Lianjia transaction overlays — listing platforms; verify with cadastre)

| Tier-1 city | New-home price band (¥/m², central districts est.) | Resale band (¥/m², est.) | YoY trend Mar 2026 (NBS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 北京 (Beijing — 西城/东城/朝阳/海淀 core) | ~70,000–150,000 ¥/m² (¥7-15万) | ~60,000–130,000 ¥/m² | new –2.1 %; resale –4 to –6 % YoY |
| 上海 (Shanghai — 黄浦/静安/徐汇/浦东陆家嘴) | ~90,000–180,000+ ¥/m² (Lujiazui prime up to ¥20万+) | ~80,000–150,000 ¥/m² | new +3.7 % (only Tier-1 still positive); resale flat-to-down |
| 深圳 (Shenzhen — 福田/南山/罗湖) | ~80,000–150,000 ¥/m² (南山科技园区 highest) | ~70,000–130,000 ¥/m² | new –5.5 %; resale –6 to –8 % |
| 广州 (Guangzhou — 天河/越秀/海珠) | ~40,000–80,000 ¥/m² (CBD 珠江新城 top) | ~35,000–70,000 ¥/m² | new –4.7 %; resale –5 to –7 % |

| New-Tier-1 / strong Tier-2 (Yicai 2025 ranking, **unofficial**) | Indicative new-home (¥/m²) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 杭州 Hangzhou | ~30,000–60,000 (CBD) | Tech / Alibaba HQ premium; resale active |
| 成都 Chengdu | ~15,000–30,000 (CBD) | Largest single-city stock among Tier-2 |
| 苏州 Suzhou | ~25,000–45,000 (CBD) | Yangtze Delta tier; foreign-buyer-friendly |
| 南京 Nanjing | ~25,000–45,000 (CBD) | Government / education base |
| 武汉 Wuhan | ~12,000–25,000 (CBD) | Central China hub |
| 西安 Xi'an | ~12,000–25,000 (CBD) | Northwest hub |
| 重庆 Chongqing (municipality) | ~12,000–22,000 (CBD) | One of two property-tax pilot cities |
| 天津 Tianjin (municipality) | ~15,000–28,000 (CBD) | Beijing satellite |

> All values are **wide indicative bands** drawn from NBS 70-city index trend + Beike / Lianjia / Anjuke listing aggregates Q1–Q2 2026. **Sham-listing risk is material** — always cross-verify with: (a) NBS 70-city ratio for the city, (b) at least 5 recent Beike 历史成交 transactions in the same compound (小区), (c) an on-the-ground agent visit. Listing platforms typically run **5–15 % above last transacted price** because asking ≠ done.
> **Tier classification is unofficial.** The Chinese government does not publish a tier-system. The most-cited list comes from **Yicai (第一财经)** annually, and is widely accepted but is not a regulatory definition. Use tiers for benchmarking only, not for legal categorisation.

### Compute

1. ¥/m² = listing price ÷ **建筑面积 (gross built area)** — Chinese convention; includes the unit's share of common space (公摊面积) for apartments. Newer Tier-1 stock typically 75–80 % efficiency (套内 / 建筑); older 1990s–2000s stock can drop to 60–70 %
2. Cross-check: pull last 5–10 成交 (closed transactions) for the same 小区 (residential compound) on Beike 历史成交 → median ¥/m² gives instant fairness band
3. **Trap**: 建筑面积 (gross) vs 套内面积 (interior, tile-to-tile) vs 实用面积 (usable) — listings mix these freely; older listings often understate by quoting only 套内. Always reconcile both
4. **Trap**: developer brochures quote 总价 + 单价 (total price + per-area); the 单价 is on 建筑面积; effective interior ¥/m² is 25–35 % higher
5. **Trap**: 学区房 (school-district property) carries 30–80 %+ premium — but the underlying schooling rights are subject to 多校划片 (multi-school zoning), 9年一户 (one household-per-flat-per-9-years), and frequent district-policy revisions; verify the policy of the destination 教育局 (Education Bureau) within the last 12 months — a "premium school district" entitlement can be administratively withdrawn
6. **Trap**: 公寓 / 商住 (40-year-LUR commercial-residential) properties trade 30–50 % below adjacent residential 70-year-LUR units of equivalent specification because of: shorter LUR (no auto-renewal under Art. 359), higher 40-year deed tax, no school-district rights, higher utility tariff (commercial), no 燃气 town-gas (electric only), and weaker mortgageability (max 50 % LTV typical, max 10-yr term). **Always confirm 70-year residential LUR before underwriting any per-m² benchmark**
7. **Trap**: 公摊面积 (shared common-area share) is part of 建筑面积 for tax + transaction but is owned collectively — owners pay for 30 %+ that they cannot occupy. Reform discussions ([MoHURD 2024 study group](https://www.mohurd.gov.cn/)) have explored 套内面积 (interior-only) as the future basis but no nationwide change announced; some new pilots (e.g., 2024 张家界, Hunan) trial 套内 sale
8. **Trap**: 70-yr LUR remaining < 20 yrs creates mortgage + resale headwinds even before Art. 359 auto-renewal mechanics tested. Verify the **LUR start date** on the 不动产权证书 (Real-Estate Title Certificate); subtract from 70 to get remaining

### Trend 2021 → Q2 2026 (post-Evergrande market context)

- **Sustained bear cycle 2021 → 2024**: 4–5 consecutive years of declining new-home prices in lower-tier cities; cumulative real-terms decline of 25–35 % in Tier-3/4 markets ([Bloomberg 2025-11](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/china-property-crisis-why-market-is-a-mess-what-stimulus-measures-are-planned))
- **Developer-side defaults**: Evergrande 恒大 (US$300B+ liabilities; HKEx delisted Aug 2025; court-ordered liquidation Jan 2024 — [CNBC 2025-08](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/evergrandes-rise-and-fall-leaves-scars-on-chinas-property-sector.html)); Country Garden 碧桂园 (winding-up petition 2024; hearing extended Jan 2025); Sunac 融创, Shimao 世茂, Kaisa 佳兆业, Sino-Ocean 远洋 — bulk of top-50 developers in distress / restructuring
- **保交楼 ("delivered-housing-promise") policy**: launched Aug 2022 ([State Council 国务院 directives](https://www.gov.cn/)); expanded 2023–2024; ~1.2 trillion ¥ developer liabilities cleared via court-supervised restructuring through 2025 ([gov.cn 2025-12](https://www.gov.cn/)); priority is finishing **pre-sold but not delivered** units (the 烂尾楼 "unfinished-tail" inventory) — buyers of distressed-developer pre-sales should verify 保交楼 inclusion AND timeline before completion
- **Sept 2024 stimulus package** ([gov.cn 2024-09](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202409/25/content_WS66f3602ec6d0868f4e8eb3c0.html)): minimum down-payment cut to 15 % first-home / 15 % second-home; mortgage rate floor abolished for most cities; tier-1 cities relaxed Hukou / social-security rules (see § Foreign-buyer overlay above); Guangzhou fully removed all home-purchase restrictions
- **Nov 2024 deed-tax + LVAT reductions** ([gov.cn 2024-11-14](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202411/14/content_WS673591d5c6d0868f4e8eceeb.html)): see § `--tax`
- **2025 stabilisation skewed**: Shanghai +3.7 % YoY March 2026 (only Tier-1 still positive); Beijing –2.1 %, Guangzhou –4.7 %, Shenzhen –5.5 % March 2026 (NBS); 70-city aggregate –3.4 % YoY ([scio.gov.cn 2026-04](http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2026-04/16/content_118441356.html))
- **2026 outlook**: PBOC + MoHURD signalling "stop the decline, restore stability" 止跌回稳; further fiscal/monetary support expected; developer-side consolidation continues. Buyer base structurally smaller (demographic peak passed; Hukou-constrained tier-1 demand); Tier-3/4 inventory still elevated ~2024–2030 absorption horizon

---

## Section: `--traffic`

### Primary source

- **交通运输部 (Ministry of Transport, MoT)** — `https://www.mot.gov.cn/` — national road & transport statistics; annual 公路交通量调查 (Highway Traffic Volume Survey) per province
- **中国统计年鉴 (China Statistical Yearbook, NBS)** — `https://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/` — annual transport tables
- **省/市 交通运输厅/局** — provincial / municipal transport bureaus publish AADT counts on national + provincial highways (国道 G-roads / 省道 S-roads). Coverage is uneven; major highways (e.g., G1, G2, G3, G4 expressways) well-documented; urban arterials less so
- **百度地图 / 高德地图 (Baidu Maps / Amap / AutoNavi)** — real-time congestion + heatmap; not formal AADT but **the only practical real-time tool inside mainland China** (Google Maps blocked); Amap publishes annual urban congestion reports

### Key term

China uses **AADT (年平均日交通量)** for highway counts. Inside cities, **道路饱和度 (road saturation ratio)** + **路段服务水平 (level of service)** classifications are common in municipal transport-bureau reports.

### Verdict bands (residential-noise scale, mainland-Chinese arterial context)

- 🟢 < 5,000 v/d (interior estate road inside a 小区, neighbourhood lane)
- 🟡 5,000–25,000 v/d (district feeder, secondary city street)
- 🟠 25,000–80,000 v/d (urban arterial, e.g., 长安街 Beijing, 中山路 Shanghai, 深南大道 Shenzhen)
- 🔴 > 80,000 v/d (urban expressway / 二/三/四/五环路 ring-road, intercity G-expressway; saturation > 150,000 on inner ring roads typical)

### Coarse fallback (OSM `highway`)

- motorway = 高速公路 (G-class, S-class expressways)
- trunk = 城市快速路 / 一级公路
- primary = 主干道 (principal arterial)
- secondary = 次干道 (secondary arterial)
- residential = 支路 / 小区内道
- service = 内部道路

### Notes

- Tier-1 cities (Beijing / Shanghai / Shenzhen / Guangzhou) cap private-vehicle registration via 牌照摇号 (licence-plate lottery, Beijing since 2011; Shanghai 拍牌 auction, average plate price ~¥80k–100k Q1 2026); Shenzhen + Guangzhou hybrid lottery+auction; result is **plate scarcity**, not road saturation reduction — congestion remains heavy
- **Trap**: properties advertised "near subway" (近地铁) — verify **walking** distance via Amap pedestrian routing; "10-min walk" claims often translate to 800-1200 m and 15+ min in practice
- **Trap**: ring-road properties — inner-ring noise + air-quality penalty; outer-ring (4环 / 5环 outer Beijing, S-roads Shanghai) often combined with elevated viaducts amplifying nighttime noise. Request developer-supplied **声环境检测报告 (Acoustic Environment Test Report)** for new-build within 100 m of arterial / expressway — required under [GB 3096-2008 Acoustic Environment Standard](https://www.mee.gov.cn/) but rarely volunteered

## Section: `--tax`

### Annual property charges (recurring)

Mainland China has **NO nationwide recurring property tax** for residential property held by individuals as of May 2026. Two pilot programs only:

| Pilot city | Effective | Scope | Rates (2024 reference) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **上海 (Shanghai)** | 28 Jan 2011 | Newly-purchased 2nd+ residential by Shanghai-Hukou residents AND any newly-purchased residential by non-Shanghai-Hukou (incl. foreigners). 60 m² per family member exemption | **0.4 %** if unit price ≤ 2× prior-year city avg new-home price; **0.6 %** if above 2× | [Shanghai Tax Bureau](https://www.tax.sh.gov.cn/) |
| **重庆 (Chongqing)** | 28 Jan 2011 | Newly-purchased high-end villas + newly-purchased 2nd home by non-Chongqing-Hukou + apartments above price threshold | **0.5 %** below 2× city avg; **1.0 %** 2–3×; **1.2 %** > 3× city avg | [Chongqing Tax Bureau](http://chongqing.chinatax.gov.cn/) |

> Both pilots launched simultaneously 2011-01-28 ([State Council Notice on Pilot Reform](http://www.gov.cn/)). Coverage is narrow (newly-purchased, mostly upper segment); revenue is small (< 5 % of municipal own-source revenue in either city, 2024 estimates). Academic estimates ([Lincoln Institute 2024](https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/articles/chinas-property-tax-reform/)) put the **Shanghai price effect at –11 to –15 %** in covered segments and **Chongqing at +10–12 %** in luxury (sustained demand offset).
>
> **No nationwide rollout has occurred or been formally scheduled.** A 2021 NPC Standing Committee resolution authorised expanded pilots; that authority **lapsed in 2026** per [Caixin / SCMP coverage 2024–2025] without expansion. Repeated official statements 2023–2025 indicate the property-tax expansion is "paused" while the property market stabilises. Reverify via [State Taxation Administration (STA) — chinatax.gov.cn](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/) before relying on absence of a tax in any specific city.

**Other recurring charges** (not "property tax" per se):

| Charge | Base | Typical rate | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **物业管理费 (property management fee)** | per m² built area per month | ¥1.5–6.0 /m²/mo low-mid; ¥8–15 /m²/mo luxury / international Tier-1 | Paid to 物业管理公司; covers security, cleaning, lifts, garden |
| **取暖费 (heating fee — northern cities only, October–March)** | per m² built area per heating season | ¥18–30 /m²/season (e.g., Beijing ~¥30/m², Shanghai exempt by latitude convention) | Mandatory for centralised-heating buildings north of Yangtze line |
| **卫生 / 垃圾费 (sanitation)** | per household | ¥10–60 /yr | Marginal |

### Transaction taxes (one-time at purchase)

**契税 / Deed Tax** — buyer pays; nationwide; rules effective **1 Dec 2024** ([gov.cn 2024-11-14](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202411/14/content_WS673591d5c6d0868f4e8eceeb.html); [Caixin 2024-11-15](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2024-11-15/china-cuts-property-tax-102257509.html)):

| Property scenario | Unit ≤ 140 m² | Unit > 140 m² |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1st residential (家庭唯一住房) | **1 %** | **1.5 %** |
| 2nd residential (家庭第二套住房) | **1 %** | **2 %** |
| 3rd+ residential | **3 %** (standard rate; no concession) | 3 % |
| Non-residential (commercial / office) | 3 % | 3 % |

(Pre-Dec-2024 schedule had 1 % / 1.5 % / 3 % first-home + 1 % / 2 % / 3 % second-home cliff at 90 m² — replaced by the 140 m² single-cliff above.)

> The **140 m² break and the 3 % top rate apply nationwide except in tier-1 cities Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen** which retained higher cliffs for second homes during the 2024 transition; Beijing aligned partially Nov 2024, Shanghai aligned Dec 2024. **Verify with the local 税务局 (Tax Bureau) website for the destination city** before underwriting.

**增值税 / Value-Added Tax (VAT) — seller pays** (or passed to buyer in seller's-net agreements):

| Holding period | Pre-2026 rate | From 1 Jan 2026 |
|---|---:|---:|
| < 2 years | **5 % of full sale price** | **3 %** ([gov.cn 2025-12-30](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202512/30/content_WS6953dc2dc6d00ca5f9a08574.html); [Caixin 2025-12-31](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-12-31/china-trims-vat-on-short-held-home-sales-as-property-easing-continues-102399207.html)) |
| ≥ 2 years (普通住宅 ordinary housing) | **0 % (exempt)** | 0 % (exempt) |
| ≥ 2 years (非普通住宅 non-ordinary / luxury, Tier-1 only) | 5 % on price-cost margin | 5 % on price-cost margin (verify; reform language ambiguous) |

> "普通住宅" (ordinary housing) vs "非普通住宅" definitions are city-specific (combination of unit area, plot ratio, and unit price relative to city benchmark). Tier-1 cities historically applied stricter "non-ordinary" floors that captured most central-district stock — **Shanghai abolished the 普通/非普通 distinction Nov 2024**; **Beijing and Shenzhen aligned Dec 2024**; **Guangzhou aligned 2024**. Verify per city before computing VAT.

**个人所得税 / Individual Income Tax on capital gain — seller pays**:

| Method | Rate | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| **Verifiable cost basis** (buyer purchase price + verified renovation + interest + transaction taxes documented) | **20 % × (sale price − cost basis)** | Used when full purchase paperwork available |
| **Deemed (核定) method** (no documentation) | **1 %** of full sale price (residential, most cities) | Default fallback; rates 1 %–3 % vary by city; Beijing 1 %, Shanghai 1 %, Shenzhen 1.5 % — verify |
| **Family-only-home + ≥ 5 yr held exemption** | **0 %** | If seller can prove the unit is the family's only residential property AND held ≥ 5 yrs, full IIT exemption applies under [STA Notice 国税发 2006/108] |

**土地增值税 / Land Value-Added Tax (LVAT)** — applies to **sale by enterprises / developers**, not individuals selling personal residence (individual-seller LVAT is **exempt** under [Cai Shui 2008/137]). Developer side: progressive 30–60 % on the appreciation portion (value-add over cost) per [LVAT Provisional Regulations](https://fgk.chinatax.gov.cn/zcfgk/c100010/c5194433/content.html).

**印花税 / Stamp Duty**: residential individual sale **exempt** since 2008 (Cai Shui 2008/137).

**Other transaction-side costs**:

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| **不动产登记费 / Real-estate registration fee** | ¥80 per property (residential) — ¥550 (non-residential) — fixed nationwide [MoF / NDRC schedule] |
| **测绘费 / Survey fee** (if not yet completed) | ¥1.36 / m² typical, capped per locality |
| **公证费 / Notary fee** (if elected — not mandatory for resale) | 0.3 % of price (older 2008 schedule, capped); declining due to non-mandatory status |
| **中介费 / Agent commission** | typically **2–3 % of price**, split buyer + seller (commonly 1.5 + 1.5 % or 2 % buyer / 1 % seller); Beike publishes 2 % platform fee with rebates; capped voluntarily by 2018 industry agreement at 2.7 % combined |
| **银行评估费 / Bank valuation fee** (if mortgaged) | ¥500–¥3,000 per property |
| **律师费 / Lawyer fee** (optional but recommended for foreign buyers) | ¥3,000–¥30,000 depending on complexity |

### Capital gains / income tax on sale by foreign individual

- IIT 20 % on capital gain; same rule as PRC citizens (no separate non-resident schedule for property gain) — **but** if foreign-individual seller is a non-resident (< 183 days in PRC in tax year), withholding may differ — verify with [STA Non-Resident Tax page](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/) and any applicable bilateral tax treaty
- **No exit tax** at sale per se, but FX repatriation requires SAFE quota / approval (see § `--currency`)

### Rental income tax (individual landlord)

- **Individual Income Tax (IIT)** on rental: per [PwC 2025 China Tax Facts](https://www.pwccn.com/en/tax/publications/people-republic-of-china-tax-facts-2025.pdf) and [PwC Tax Summaries](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peoples-republic-of-china/individual/income-determination):
  - Standard rate: **20 % flat** on rental income
  - Allowable deduction: ¥800 if monthly gross ≤ ¥4,000; **20 % deemed deduction** if monthly gross > ¥4,000
  - Effective rate on rental > ¥4,000/mo: **20 % × 80 % = 16 %**
- **VAT** on rental by individual: 5 % nominal, with **¥100,000/month threshold** exempting most small landlords (since 2023; verify current threshold)
- **Property Management surcharge**: paid by lessor / lessee per contract
- **房产税 (House Property Tax) on individual let-out residential**: **12 % flat on rental** under [Provisional Regulations on House Property Tax 1986](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/) — long-standing law but selectively enforced for individual residential lessors; commercial lessors / tenants more aggressively enforced. Some cities (e.g., Beijing) reduce the 12 % to **4 %** for individual let-out residential (verify locally). **Tax authorities are tightening enforcement 2024–2025 via tenant-side withholding pilots** — assume full liability when underwriting
- **Foreign-individual landlord under 171号文**: rental of foreign-purchased residential is **technically not permitted under 171 (one-property-for-own-use)**; in practice enforcement varies, but tax / regulatory exposure exists. **Do not underwrite a buy-to-let plan as a foreign individual without local tax / legal advice.**

### Future risk

- **Nationwide property tax**: pilots since 2011 (Shanghai / Chongqing); 2021 NPC pilot-expansion authority **lapsed unused 2026**; near-term rollout suspended pending market recovery — but the legal framework remains and a 2027–2030 reintroduction is a meaningful long-horizon risk
- **VAT cut to 3 % for < 2-yr holds (eff. 2026-01-01)** signals continued easing; further developer-side concessions plausible; demand-side stamp / IIT tweaks frequent (4× in 2024 alone)
- **Hukou + social-security / IIT thresholds** continue to ease in tier-1 cities; foreigner 171号文 1-year rule has not been amended since 2006 — has been considered for tightening (2017) and easing (2025) but stable as of 2026-05
- **40-yr LUR commercial-residential 公寓** segment faces structural headwinds: no Civil Code Art. 359 auto-renewal, no school-district rights, no Hukou attachment. Resale market for 40-yr stock fragile

---

## Section: `--rental`

### Long-term residential

- **Tenancy law**: [Civil Code 民法典 第二编 物权 + 第三编 合同 (Lease chapter)](http://www.npc.gov.cn/) — minimum statutory protections; max single lease term **20 years** (Art. 705); written contracts mandatory > 6 months; deposit + advance payment customary
- **Standard tenancy structure**: 12-month fixed term most common; **1-month deposit + 1-month or 3-month advance** in mainland use (押一付三 — "one deposit + 3-month advance" Tier-1 standard); landlord typically pays property-tax / management-fee portion attributable to 公摊; tenant pays utilities + heating
- **Rent-control**: no nationwide statutory rent control; tier-1 cities monitor "fair rent guidance" indices but enforcement light for private-residential. Rent caps in some 公租房 (public-rental housing) categories — irrelevant to foreign-buyer scenarios
- **Foreign-individual letting**: technically restricted under 171号文 (one property for own residential use); enforcement varies — see § `--tax` above

### Yields (Q4 2025, Tier-1 city aggregates from Beike 历史成交 + Lianjia rental boards; verify per project)

| Tier-1 city | Gross rental yield (avg) |
|---|---:|
| 北京 (Beijing) | ~1.4–1.8 % |
| 上海 (Shanghai) | ~1.6–2.2 % |
| 深圳 (Shenzhen) | ~1.5–2.0 % |
| 广州 (Guangzhou) | ~1.8–2.4 % |
| New Tier-1 (Hangzhou / Chengdu / Suzhou) | ~2.0–3.0 % |
| Tier-2 (Wuhan / Xi'an / Chongqing) | ~2.5–3.5 % |
| Tier-3+ | ~3.0–4.5 % gross (but capital-value risk + low liquidity) |

> Mainland Chinese gross residential yields are **structurally low** by emerging-market standards because (a) capital-value compounding 2010–2021 outpaced rents; (b) rental income is disfavoured culturally vs ownership ("买房" mentality); (c) school-district premium inflates capital values without commensurate rent. Net yields after property management fee + heating + IIT + house-property-tax + vacancy + agent + repair sit **0.5–1.5 % below gross** in Tier-1, somewhat higher in Tier-2.

### Short-term rentals (短租 / 民宿 / Airbnb)

**Status (2026)**: regulated; Airbnb withdrew from mainland China retail bookings effective **30 July 2022** ([Airbnb press release 2022-05-23](https://news.airbnb.com/)) due to operational complexity + COVID-era policy; outbound Chinese travel still served. Domestic platforms 木鸟民宿 / 途家 / 美团民宿 / 小猪短租 / 飞猪 / Booking now dominate.

- **Hotel & Accommodation Operating Licence (公安 + 文旅 双证)**: short-term commercial accommodation strictly requires 公安 (Public Security Bureau) **特种行业许可证** + **文化旅游 (Tourism) registration**; many residential-zoned units **cannot legally operate Airbnb-style nightly** because the 物业 (HOA-equivalent) and the 业主大会 (owners assembly) of the building must consent + zoning must permit
- **公寓 (40-yr commercial-residential)**: typically the only legal short-term-let asset class; many residential 70-yr 小区 ban transient rental in their 业主公约
- **Foreign guest registration**: hosts must register foreign guests at the local 派出所 (police station) within 24 hrs of check-in under [Exit & Entry Administration Law 2012 Art. 39](http://www.gov.cn/) — non-compliance = ¥2,000 fine + potential operating-licence loss
- **Tier-1 city overlay**: Beijing + Shanghai have intermittent Airbnb-style enforcement sweeps; Shenzhen + Guangzhou somewhat more relaxed; Hainan has resort-licensed 民宿 frameworks; Niche tourist destinations (Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang) more permissive but with separate public-security registration burdens
- **Strategic conclusion**: a credible mainland short-let strategy is **legitimate-licensed 民宿 in tourist-zoned 公寓** (40-yr LUR), **not** Airbnb-style nightly in 70-yr residential. Returns net of regulatory / licensing / management cost rarely beat long-let in Tier-1; some Tier-2 tourist cities (Sanya, Dali, Kunming, Lijiang, Chengdu) work seasonally

### Tax + reporting on rental

- IIT 20 % on rental (effective 16 % after 20 % deemed deduction) — see § `--tax`
- House Property Tax 12 % flat (Beijing 4 %); enforcement intensifying 2024–2025
- VAT 5 % above ¥100,000/month threshold (most individual landlords exempt)
- Annual settlement via [STA myTax mobile app 个税 APP](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/) by 30 June for prior calendar year
- Foreign-individual landlord: see 171号文 caveats above

### Strategic notes

- Foreign individual buying for **own-use only** (consistent with 171号文): structurally easier; no rental tax / regulatory complexity; pure capital-value exposure
- Foreign individual buying for **family-member's use**: legally grey; depends on 171号文 interpretation in destination city — verify with local 房屋管理局 (Housing Bureau)
- Foreign individual buying for **rental yield**: **highly inadvisable** without local PRC entity (WFOE) ownership structure; structural complexity often outweighs return; PRC tax-treaty position for the home country must be checked
- Foreign individual buying for **capital appreciation + future relocation**: most common profile; underwrite at the lowest yield band + assume nominal capital appreciation ≤ inflation through 2030 absorption cycle

### Catchment heuristics

- Tier-1 city core: 30-min metro reaches full white-collar catchment (e.g., Beijing 国贸 / Shanghai 陆家嘴 / Shenzhen 福田 / Guangzhou 珠江新城)
- 60-min metro: most second-ring corporate / R&D campuses (Beijing 望京 / 中关村, Shanghai 张江 / 漕河泾, Shenzhen 南山 / 龙华, Guangzhou 天河 / 番禺)
- New-Tier-1 (Hangzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Nanjing): ~45-min metro core; city-state-style commute reach
- Tier-2 / Tier-3: subway expansion ongoing 2024–2030; verify the destination metro line operating + latest extension via [中国城市轨道交通协会 (China Urban Rail Transit Association)](https://www.camet.org.cn/)

### Visa / residence pathway for working foreigners

- See § Country profile / Visa above (Z, X, Q, R, PR)
- **Z visa pathway dominant** for employed foreigners; converted to **居留许可 (work-residence permit)** within 30 days of arrival
- **R visa (high talent)**: A-class top talent track (科技人才 / Outstanding Foreign Talent) — fast-track, multiple-entry, easier renewal; managed via 中华人民共和国外国人来华工作许可制度 ([SAFEA / 国家外国专家局](http://www.safea.gov.cn/))
- PR (永久居留 / "Chinese Green Card"): selective; investment / talent / family / 4-yr-work tracks; through 2024 cumulative grants estimated < 30,000 individuals total
- **Tax residency**: 183-day rule per [IIT Law 2018 + 个税法实施条例 2018]; foreign individuals < 183 days/yr taxed only on China-sourced income; ≥ 183 days for 6 consecutive years are taxed on worldwide income (with 6-year reset rule via 30+-day single absence)

### Natural-hazard profile (highly geographically variable)

China spans **22 climate zones + 5 seismic-fortification intensity bands**; risk profile differs sharply by city. Headline patterns:

- **Earthquakes**: high-seismic belts include 西部 (Sichuan-Yunnan-Tibet), 西南 (Hengduan ranges), 京津唐 (Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan), 东北 (NE China). [GB 18306-2015](https://www.gb18306.net/) maps fortification intensity 6–8+ for most populous regions; major historical events: 2008 汶川 (M8.0; ~70k deaths), 1976 唐山 (M7.5–7.8; ~242k deaths). All Tier-1 cities sit in 7+ design intensity. Verify property's **抗震设防烈度 (seismic-fortification intensity)** + structure type via developer documentation + 住建部 supervisory records
- **Typhoons / coastal storms**: SE coast (Guangdong / Fujian / Zhejiang / Shanghai / Hainan / Taiwan Strait facing) hit ~5–9 typhoons/season July–October; Hainan + south Guangdong highest exposure; Shanghai metro vulnerable to peripheral effects
- **Floods**: Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, Pearl river basins flood-prone; 2020 catastrophic Yangtze + 2021 Henan (Zhengzhou subway flood, ~398 deaths) recent reference points; urban pluvial flooding intensifying with climate change
- **Air quality**: long-term PM2.5 elevated relative to WHO guidelines; northern industrial belt (HBJ — Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Beijing) historically highest. **2024 nationwide annual avg PM2.5 ≈ 29.3 µg/m³** (MEE data; vs WHO 2021 AQG of 5 µg/m³); Tier-1 averages: Beijing ~33, Shanghai ~26, Shenzhen ~22, Guangzhou ~24 (2024). Continued multi-decadal improvement vs 2013 (Beijing then ~89 µg/m³) but still 5–7× WHO guideline. Sandstorms episodic in Beijing March–May
- **Ground subsidence**: Shanghai, Tianjin, North-China-Plain agricultural belt — multi-decade groundwater-extraction-driven subsidence (Shanghai cumulative 2.5+ m since 1921; rate slowed to ~5–10 mm/yr with extraction controls). Pearl Delta also subsiding; affects long-term coastal-flood + structural integrity
- **Landslides / debris flow**: SW China (Sichuan / Yunnan / Guizhou); rural / mountainous; less material for urban / Tier-1 buyers
- **Drought**: northern China structurally water-stressed; South-North Water Transfer Project (南水北调) operational since 2014 East/Middle routes
- **Extreme heat**: rising frequency of 35°C+ days in lower Yangtze + South China; 2022 was record (Chongqing, Wuhan exceeded 40°C multiple consecutive days)

### Build-era hazards (mainland Chinese residential stock)

| Era | Hazard rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-1980** | 🟠 | Pre-reform era; thin walls, no central heating south of Yangtze; asbestos likely; many already demolished or pending 城中村 / 棚改 redevelopment |
| **1980–2000 (early reform-era)** | 🟠 | First-generation commodity housing post-1998 housing reform; varied seismic compliance; mortgage-marketed but quality variable |
| **2000–2012 (boom era)** | 🟡 | Bulk of current stock; most followed [GB 50011-2010 Code for Seismic Design]; 公摊 ratios often opaque; check structural inspection records |
| **2012–2020** | 🟢 | Code [GB 50011-2010] strictly applied; energy-efficiency standards (北方居住建筑节能 1995, JGJ 26-95 successive updates); [Green Building Standard 绿色建筑 GB/T 50378] increasingly mandatory |
| **2020+** | 🟢 | Current code: [GB 50011-2010 + 2024 amendments]; mandatory pre-sale escrow tightening post-Evergrande; "保交楼" supervision |
| **Pre-sold by distressed developer 2020–2024** | 🔴 | "烂尾楼" risk: pre-paid units never delivered; verify 保交楼 inclusion + completion date before any pre-sale purchase |

**Asbestos**: prevalent pre-1990 build; demolition / renovation must use licensed contractor under [GBZ/T 222-2009 Workplace Asbestos Sampling Guideline]; pre-purchase test recommended for any pre-1990 stock
**Radon**: regional variation; some southern provinces with granitic geology elevated; [GB 50325-2020 Civil Building Indoor Air-Quality Code] mandatory radon limits at delivery (build-quality measure)

### En bloc / 棚改 / 城中村 redevelopment (拆迁) risk

- **棚改 (shantytown redevelopment)** + **城中村改造 (urban-village reform)**: government-led demolition + relocation of older / sub-standard stock. From 2024 the 城中村改造 programme was expanded to **35 mega-cities** ([gov.cn 2023-07-21 Politburo + State Council], with 2025 acceleration) — buyers in older / village-style stock could face compulsory acquisition with cash compensation OR replacement-housing — terms set by local government. Both upside (compensation often above market) AND downside (timing uncertain, dispute risk)
- Verify **拆迁 risk status** via local 自然资源局 / 住建局 zoning portal + 控制性详细规划 (Controlled Detailed Plan) overlay before underwriting

### Mandatory documents at sale (resale residential)

| Document | Required because | Source |
|---|---|---|

| **学区 confirmation letter (where applicable)** | School-district status | 教育局 |
| **税务清算 (final tax clearance) at deed-transfer** | Required by 不动产登记中心 | 税务局 |

### Climate change projections (CMA + IPCC AR6 China downscaled)

- **Annual mean temperature**: +1.5 to +3.0°C nationwide by 2050 SSP2-4.5; +2.0 to +5.0°C by 2100 SSP5-8.5 ([CMA Third National Climate Assessment Report 第三次气候变化国家评估报告](https://www.cma.gov.cn/))
- **Heatwaves**: 35°C+ day count to double by 2050 in lower Yangtze
- **Extreme rainfall**: +15–30 % intensity by 2100 in south + east
- **Sea-level rise (Chinese coast)**: +0.4 to +1.2 m by 2100 high-end (CMA + IPCC AR6); Pearl Delta + Yangtze Delta + Bohai Bay especially exposed
- **Drought**: northern China stress intensifying; South-North Water Transfer expansion likely
- **Air quality co-benefits**: continued PM2.5 decline path through 2030+ from "carbon-peak" targets, but progress slowing in last 20 % to WHO guideline

## Section: `--mains`

Mains water + electricity + gas + sewerage are **near-universal in urban mainland China** — every legally completed urban residential development since 1990 has all four. **Rural / peri-urban (城乡结合部) properties may have partial provision** — verify per parcel.

### Operators

| Utility | Operator | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Water + sewerage** | 自来水公司 (city-level water utility) — e.g., 北京市自来水集团, 上海城投水务, 深圳水务 | Tariffs city-set; subsidised residential; commercial higher tier |
| **Electricity** | **国家电网 (State Grid)** for ~88 % of national territory + **南方电网 (Southern Grid)** for Guangdong / Guangxi / Yunnan / Guizhou / Hainan | Tariff: residential ~¥0.50–0.62 /kWh tier 1, rising to ~¥0.80 /kWh tier 3 (peak); commercial ~¥0.85+ /kWh |
| **Gas (town gas)** | 中燃 / 港华燃气 / 北京燃气 / 上海燃气 — mostly partly-state mixed-ownership | Pipeline gas in most Tier-1/2 urban; some peri-urban LPG cylinder |
| **Heating (winter only — north of Yangtze)** | 集中供暖 (district heating) network — operator varies by city | Mandatory billing for connected buildings; opt-out limited |
| **Telecoms / fibre** | China Telecom 中国电信, China Unicom 中国联通, China Mobile 中国移动 — state-owned big-3 | Fibre-to-home universal in Tier-1/2; Gigabit common Tier-1 |

### Verification

- For new-build (商品房) post-2010: utility connection certified at 验收 (inspection) before 五证齐全 (five-certificate completion) — assume all four mains present
- For older stock (pre-1998 housing-reform legacy units, 房改房, 单位福利房): verify each utility individually with the 物业 (property management) and the building 居委会 (residential committee)
- For 公寓 (40-yr commercial-residential): often **commercial-tier electricity tariff** (~30–50 % higher than residential) + **no town-gas in some cities** (electric cooking only) + **commercial water tariff** + **no district heating in northern cities** — material total-cost-of-ownership impact; verify before underwriting
- **Trap**: rural villas / 农村自建房 / 小产权房 ("small-property-right" houses on rural collective land — **NOT legal commodity housing for foreign or non-Hukou-village buyers**) — utility provision often informal; 小产权房 is a separate non-purchasable category; **never buy 小产权房 as a foreign individual**

### Costs (Tier-1 city, 2025 reference)

| Scenario | Cost |
|---|---|
| Water (residential, < tier 1 cap, urban) | ~¥4–6 /m³; capped tier 1 typically 220 m³/yr/household |
| Electricity (residential, tier 1) | ¥0.50–0.62 /kWh; cap ~2,160 kWh/yr; tier 3 reaches ¥0.78–0.85 /kWh |
| Town gas (residential) | ¥2.5–3.5 /m³ |
| Northern district heating (winter) | ¥18–30 /m²/season (Beijing ~¥30, Tianjin ~¥25, Harbin ~¥40+) |
| Average household monthly utility bill (Tier-1, 2 occupants, 90 m² apartment) | ~¥400–800/mo (excl. winter heating) |
| Property management fee | ¥1.5–6.0 /m²/mo standard; ¥8–15 /m²/mo luxury / international |

(Verify all current tariffs at the city utility's website at the time of bill date — tier ladders are city-set and revised periodically.)

## Section: `--currency` (China-specific override — material to all foreign-buyer scenarios)

### RMB capital controls — the operative constraint

Mainland China operates a **partially closed capital account**. **The single most material constraint for foreign property buyers is FX inflow / outflow**.

### SAFE individual FX quota

- **State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE / 国家外汇管理局)** — `https://www.safe.gov.cn/en/` — administers RMB convertibility
- **Individual annual FX purchase / sale quota: equivalent of US$50,000 per person per year** ([SAFE 个人外汇管理办法 2007, amended periodically — verify annual increase if any](https://www.safe.gov.cn/))
- **PRC citizens** sending CNY abroad: subject to the US$50K equivalent annual quota; aggregation across family members or split-transactions is **outright illegal** (split-purchase by 5+ named individuals on linked transactions = 蚂蚁搬家 "ants moving" — flagged by SAFE and bank AML monitoring)
- **Foreign individuals** bringing FX into China to buy property: **separate inflow rules** under [SAFE 2025-09-15 Notice on Cross-Border Investment Reform](https://www.safe.gov.cn/) — overseas individuals lawfully resident and working in China can settle FX for property purchase based on the contract at the initial stage (rolled out nationwide September 2025; previously HK/Macao residents only). **Foreign buyers must keep all FX-inflow records** (inbound bank wire receipts, declaration to local SAFE branch)
- **Sale-side repatriation** (foreign individual selling PRC property and converting CNY proceeds back to FX for outflow): **highly process-heavy** — requires:
  1. Original FX-inflow proof (bank receipts, original SAFE inbound declaration)
  2. Property tax-clearance certificate at sale
  3. Original purchase contract + sale contract notarised
  4. SAFE 个人结售汇 (individual FX purchase/sale) approval at the local SAFE branch
  5. Bank-level execution
- **Repatriation timeline**: 1–6 months typical for clean cases; can extend > 12 months in complex cases (missing receipts, cross-decade ownership, marital-property disputes)
- **Repatriation FX rate**: spot CNY/foreign currency at execution day — exchange-rate movement risk between sale and outflow is real (CNY weakened ~12 % vs USD 2022–2024)
- **Key risk**: **if FX-inflow documentation was incomplete at original purchase, repatriation may be impossible or delayed indefinitely**. Foreign buyers MUST keep meticulous FX-inflow records from day 1

### CNH (offshore renminbi) and HKD-pegged context

- Onshore CNY and offshore CNH typically trade within ±300 bps of each other; can diverge in stress events (e.g., 2015 deval, 2022 Q3-Q4)
- Hong Kong CNH market provides limited deliverable hedging for property-sale-proceeds FX risk; not all retail Chinese banks support CNH transactions
- **Foreign buyers should consider FX-hedging the sale-side (CNY → home-currency) at planned exit**, especially for sub-5-year holds — the cost of NDF / CNH-DF hedging is small relative to a 10–20 % FX move

### CNY trend 2022 → 2026

- USD/CNY climbed from ~6.35 (Q1 2022) → ~7.30+ (Q3 2024) → ~7.10–7.30 (Q1–Q2 2026 range, PBOC fix)
- PBOC managed-float kept depreciation orderly; no full free-float planned
- Long-term: structural CNY softening probable as growth gap with US narrows but capital-account controls retained — foreign property holders bear the carry-cost of the closed capital account

### Practical foreign-buyer FX checklist

1. Keep ORIGINAL inbound bank wire receipts AND original SAFE inbound declaration paperwork — store off-PRC copies
2. Confirm purchase contract is in your individual name (NOT a relative / nominee — repatriation requires owner = original FX-inflow declarant)
3. Pay all property-related taxes from **the same SAFE-declared account** to maintain audit trail
4. At sale, expect 2–6+ months between transaction completion and FX repatriation
5. Hedge or lock CNY → home-currency at sale-contract signing if exit is < 5-year horizon

## Caveats unique to mainland CN

- **No private freehold over land** — 70-year Land Use Right (residential) is leasehold-equivalent; 40-year (commercial-residential) shorter and without auto-renewal under Civil Code Art. 359
- **Civil Code Art. 359 auto-renewal residential — but renewal-fee mechanics statutorily undefined** (deferred to "future regulations"); no large-scale 70-yr-LUR-expiry test has occurred yet (the first commercial 1990s grants will expire ~2060+, residential ~2090+); a small Wenzhou 2016 case set partial precedent but not nationally binding
- **Foreign-individual one-property-nationwide rule under 171号文 (2006)** + **1-year residence prior to purchase** — unchanged 2024–2026
- **Local Hukou / social-security overlay** in tier-1 cities: Beijing 5-yr; Shanghai 1-yr (eased Sept 2024); Shenzhen 3-yr; Guangzhou no restriction — verify with each city's 住房保障和房产管理局 / 住建委 at time of offer
- **No nationwide property tax** for individuals (May 2026); Shanghai + Chongqing pilots only; nationwide rollout suspended pending market recovery
- **Deed tax restructured Dec 2024**: 1 % / 1.5 % / 2 % / 3 % per scenario — verify current local schedule
- **VAT on sale**: 3 % from 2026-01-01 for < 2-yr holds (was 5 %); ≥ 2-yr exempt (普通住宅 city-defined; 普通/非普通 distinction abolished in tier-1 2024)
- **IIT 20 % on sale gain** OR 1 %/1.5 % deemed of price; 5-yr-only-family-home exemption available
- **House Property Tax 12 % on rental** by individual (Beijing 4 %); enforcement intensifying 2024–2025
- **Foreign-individual rental** technically restricted under 171号文 (own-use only) — assume exposure
- **SAFE individual annual FX quota US$50,000** (PRC residents converting RMB out); foreign-buyer FX inflow has separate route post-Sept 2025 reform
- **Sale-side FX repatriation** is process-heavy (2–6+ months); requires complete original FX-inflow paperwork
- **Pre-sale (期房) risk**: 烂尾楼 / undelivered units — verify 保交楼 inclusion + completion timeline; bias toward 现房 (already-completed) inventory or major-state-developer pre-sale
- **Sham listings (假房源)** prevalent across all consumer platforms (Beike/Lianjia best-controlled, 58.com worst); always cross-verify
- **公摊面积 (common-area share)** inflates 建筑面积 by 20–35 % over interior; Tier-1 luxury may have 30 %+; ¥/m² benchmarking must distinguish
- **学区房 (school-district)** premium 30–80 %+ — but school-zoning policy revisions are frequent and entitlement can be administratively withdrawn; verify within 12 months
- **公寓 (40-yr commercial-residential)** mortgage / liquidity / utility cost penalties — discount of 30–50 % vs 70-yr residential adjacent
- **小产权房 ("small-property-right" rural-collective housing)** is **legally non-purchasable** by foreign or non-Hukou-village individuals — never buy
- **Currency: CNY managed-float**; CNH offshore differs; closed capital account = real holding cost
- **Hukou-attached benefits** (school, healthcare): foreign owners do **not** receive Hukou via property purchase — purely independent regimes
- **PRC tax residency 183-day rule** + 6-year reset: foreign owners spending substantial time in China must monitor tax-residency exposure on worldwide income
- **PR (永久居留 / "Chinese Green Card")**: extremely selective; total grants since 1985 < ~30,000 individuals through 2024
- **Weak owners-association rights**: 业主大会 / 物业管理 disputes common; contracts often weighted toward developer-affiliated 物业 company; 业主自治 (owner self-governance) reform 2009+ has improved but uneven
- **Pre-Evergrande inventory overhang**: Tier-3/4 absorption horizon 2024–2030; foreign capital structurally absent from Tier-3/4
- **Niseko-equivalent foreign-tourist resort markets** in mainland CN are limited (Sanya / Hainan free-trade zone has the most material foreign-friendly residential market; ski resorts e.g., 长白山, 万达 at Changbai or 北大壶 at Jilin niche)

## Quirks to know

- **Reform cycle**: property + tax + Hukou rules in mainland China are revised on average **every 12–24 months** since 2010. Verify every numeric claim against current local-bureau publication before any decision
- **Tier classification is journalistic**, not legal; the State Council does not publish a "tier-1/2/3" list. Use Yicai (第一财经) annual ranking for benchmarking only
- **Mainland vs HK / Macao / Taiwan distinction**: never combine. Each is a separate legal regime (separate playbooks)
- **70-year LUR remaining ≠ remaining ownership horizon**: Civil Code Art. 359 auto-renewal residential gives strong-but-untested promise; underwrite with appropriate hedge
- **40-year vs 70-year LUR**: structural pricing gap of 30–50 % — never benchmark across types
- **公摊 (common-area share)**: always reconcile 建筑面积 vs 套内面积; expect 20–35 % shrinkage to interior
- **学区房 (school-district)**: a high premium that can evaporate via local Education Bureau policy revision; verify within 12 months
- **保交楼 inclusion** for distressed-developer pre-sale stock is the difference between getting your unit and an indefinite "烂尾楼" wait
- **SAFE FX inflow paperwork** must be perfect on day 1 for sale-side repatriation to work later
- **Tax-residency 183-day + 6-year rule**: if you spend > 6 months/yr in PRC, you become a tax resident
- **No nominee / split-name purchases** under 171号文; foreign-individual must be the named buyer
- **Pre-purchase inspection**: independent surveyors / 验房师 industry exists but is small; budget ¥3,000–¥10,000 for a credible inspection of pre-sale or older stock
- **"5 + 1 + 1" mortgage stress-test framework** (2017+) constrains LTV — varies by city; foreign-individual mortgageability depends on income proof + local bank policy + may require co-applicant or higher down payment
- **Mortgage product structure**: variable-rate LPR-linked since Aug 2019; reset annually on borrower-chosen reset date; fixed-rate options limited
- **Down-payment minimums (post-Sept 2024)**: 15 % first home + 15 % second home for most cities; tier-1 (BJ/SH/SZ) some districts retain 20–25 % thresholds

## Status

**Status**: ✅ fully populated as of 2026-05-07
**Confidence**: MEDIUM — primary sources (NBS, PBOC, MoHURD, SAFE, STA) are authoritative for tax / regulatory / price-index claims; tier-1 city benchmark prices are wide indicative bands drawn from Beike / Lianjia / Anjuke listing aggregates and NBS 70-city index trend, NOT parcel-level transactions; foreign-buyer 171号文 + tier-1 social-security overlay rules are city-administered and revised at 12–24-month cadence — re-verify with destination city 住建委 / 房屋管理局 before any offer; SAFE FX-inflow / outflow rules eased Sept 2025 but operational implementation varies by branch — verify; property-tax rollout suspended (May 2026) but politically live; Civil Code Art. 359 auto-renewal residential is statutorily promised but renewal-fee mechanics undefined and untested at scale.
**Last verified**: 2026-05-27

**Researched by**: Opus 4.7 (1M context, parallel-subagent batch, 2026-05).

**Notes**: Deed tax (1%/1.5%/2%/3%, eff. 2024-12-01), VAT cut (5%→3% for <2yr holds, eff. 2026-01-01), Sept 2024 stimulus (15% down + tier-1 residency easing), Civil Code Art. 359 auto-renewal residential (eff. 2021-01-01, renewal-fee TBD), 171号文 1-year residence + one-property-nationwide rule (2006, unchanged), Shanghai/Chongqing property-tax pilot (eff. 2011-01-28; 2021 NPC pilot-expansion authority lapsed 2026), SAFE Sept 2025 cross-border investment reform (HK/Macao FX-settlement rule extended nationwide; non-self-use residential restriction removed), Tier-1 city home-purchase restrictions: Beijing 5-yr SS, Shanghai 1-yr SS (eased Sept 2024 from 3-yr), Shenzhen 3-yr, Guangzhou abolished — all verified against PBOC / MoHURD / NBS / SAFE / STA / State Council English releases as of 2026-05. **Re-verify before any live decision**: city-level Hukou / social-security rules (revised every 12–24 months); current 普通/非普通 housing definitions per tier-1 city; school-district 学区 policy of destination unit's 教育局 within last 12 months; 保交楼 inclusion for any pre-sale (期房) purchase; foreign-buyer mortgage policies of destination city's banks; LUR remaining on the 不动产权证书 + projected renewal mechanics; SAFE local-branch operational implementation of Sept 2025 cross-border investment reform; current PR (Chinese Green Card) eligibility from National Immigration Administration. **Special caution**: Hong Kong / Macao / Taiwan are separate playbooks with separate legal regimes — never combine. Mainland-Chinese property tax / regulatory environment is among the most rapidly-evolving globally; this playbook is a framework, not parcel-level data. Confidence is MEDIUM (not HIGH) because (a) parcel-level pricing requires Beike 历史成交 / 不动产登记中心 lookup not feasible from outside, (b) sham-listing prevalence on consumer platforms reduces listing-data trustworthiness, (c) Civil Code Art. 359 renewal-fee mechanics remain statutorily undefined and untested at scale, (d) tier-1 city Hukou / social-security overlay rules are revised at 12–24-month cadence, (e) the post-Evergrande recovery cycle is mid-stream with continued policy support but uncertain absorption horizon for Tier-3/4 inventory.
