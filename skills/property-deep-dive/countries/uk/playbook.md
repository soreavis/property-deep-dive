### Price benchmarks (Q4 2025 / Q1 2026)

| Region | est. £/m² (apt) | est. £ (semi-detached house) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **London Zone 1-2** | ~8,000–18,000+ | ~800,000–2,500,000+ |
| **London Zone 3-6** | ~5,000–10,000 | ~500,000–1,200,000 |
| **Manchester / Birmingham core** | ~3,200–5,000 | ~280,000–550,000 |
| **Edinburgh / Bristol** | ~4,000–6,500 | ~400,000–800,000 |
| **Glasgow / Liverpool / Leeds** | ~2,500–4,000 | ~220,000–400,000 |
| **Smaller cities** | ~1,800–3,200 | ~180,000–320,000 |
| **Rural England (S/SW)** | ~2,500–4,500 | ~350,000–650,000 |
| **Rural Wales / Scotland / NI** | ~1,200–2,500 | ~150,000–300,000 |

Ranges are est. blended indicators triangulated from ONS UK House Price Index (latest) + Rightmove/Zoopla asking data — verify per-postcode against HM Land Registry Price Paid Data.

### Compute

1. £/m² = price / **GIA (Gross Internal Area)** — UK standard; check EPC for verified m²
2. **Leasehold trap**: lease <80 yrs reduces value 10–30% (marriage value); <60 yrs near unmortgageable
3. **Ground rent doubling clauses** (pre-2017 leases) — major value killer
4. Cross-check sold-price history on Rightmove + Land Registry PPD

### Key terms

- Freehold vs leasehold vs commonhold
- GIA = Gross Internal Area
- Title number = Land Registry identifier
- EPC = Energy Performance Certificate

## Caveats unique to UK

- **Leasehold trap** (flats + some new houses) — short remaining lease (<80 yrs) hugely impacts value; ground rent doubling clauses scandals
- **Cladding crisis** (post-Grenfell): EWS1 form for flats; remediation programme ongoing; some buildings remain unsellable/unmortgageable
- **RAAC concrete** (1960s–1980s) — major scandal 2023-2024 in schools, hospitals, some residential
- **Japanese knotweed** — Land Registry & TA6 disclosure; mortgage-blocking; treatment 5-yr programme
- **SDLT additional dwelling 5% surcharge** (since Oct 2024) — punitive on BTL
- **FHL abolition April 2025** — major change for short-let economics
- **Council Tax based on 1991 values** in England/Scotland (1991), 2003 in Wales — wildly outdated
- **Empty/second home premium up to +100%** since April 2024
- **Renters' Rights Bill 2025** — Section 21 abolition imminent
- **Help to Buy ended** — no scheme replacement yet
- **Northern Ireland** uses domestic rate system (capital value-based) — distinct from rest of UK
- **Scotland LBTT + ADS 8%** — punitive on additional dwelling
- **Brexit**: removed EU-resident buyer benefits; 2% non-resident SDLT surcharge

**Coverage check**: pricing, traffic, tax, rental, work, risks, mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for SDLT 2025 reform (gov.uk, multiple solicitor sources confirm), HIGH for FHL abolition (HMRC + Deloitte tax briefings), HIGH for cladding/RAAC programmes, MEDIUM for Renters' Rights Bill (still progressing through Parliament 2025-2026).
