## Section: `--price`

### Primary sources

- **CoreLogic (Cotality) Indices**: `https://www.corelogic.com.au/our-data/corelogic-indices` — daily HPI per region
- **ABS Residential Property Price Indexes** (cat 6432.0): `https://www.abs.gov.au/`

- **REIA Real Estate Market Facts**: `https://www.reia.com.au/`
- **CMP (CoreLogic Property Reports)** — paid

### Listing platforms

- **realestate.com.au** — DOMINANT (REA Group, ~4.4M monthly): `https://www.realestate.com.au`
- **Domain.com.au** — #2 (Nine Entertainment): `https://www.domain.com.au`
- Coverage near-universal across both

### 2026 price benchmarks (CoreLogic + ABS, early 2026)

| Region | House median | Unit median | YoY |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Sydney** | $1.41M | $865k | +3.2% |
| **Melbourne** | $977k | $603k | -0.6% |
| **Brisbane** | $1.18M | $845k | +6.5% |

| **Canberra** | $1.04M | $635k | -1.0% |
| **Combined regional** | $635k | — | +5.5% |

### Compute

1. AUD/sqm = price / **internal area sqm** (or per sq ft in some markets)
2. Cross-check **CoreLogic** sold-price + Domain HPI
3. **Strata levies** for units add ~$3-15k/yr (read sinking fund + admin fund)
4. Foreign buyer surcharge ~+8% (state stamp duty)

### Key terms

- Torrens title = freehold, registered
- Strata = apt complex with body corporate
- Community title = master-planned estate
- BMC = Building Management Committee (mixed-use)
- Off-the-plan = pre-construction purchase

## Caveats unique to AU

- **Foreign-buyer established-dwelling ban 1 Apr 2025 – 31 Mar 2027** (FIRB)
- **State-by-state divergence is extreme** — stamp duty, land tax, foreign surcharges, RTA all differ massively
- **Foreign owner surcharges**: NSW 9%, VIC 8%, QLD 8%, WA 7%, SA 7%
- **VIC VRLT statewide from 1 Jan 2025** + metro Melbourne unimproved land from 2026
- **VIC Short-Stay Levy 7.5%** from 1 Jan 2025
- **NSW FHBAS indexed annually from 1 Jul 2025** (was First Home Buyer Choice 2022, repealed 2023)
- **FIRB fees + vacancy fee** for foreign-owned dwellings
- **Negative gearing** + **CGT 50% discount** are unique investor features
- **Bushfire BAL ratings** drive insurance + building code; high-BAL means $50k+ retrofit
- **Pool safety certificate** mandatory pre-sale QLD
- **NSW Bush Fire Prone Land** triggers special construction
- **Section 32 (VIC)** + **Form 1 (QLD, new 1 Aug 2025)** + **Contract for Sale (NSW)** — mandatory pre-sale disclosures
- **Strata vs community title vs old-system title** — title quality varies
- **Aluminium composite cladding (post-Grenfell)** — some buildings flagged for remediation
- **Negative gearing** — deductible against other income
- **AHPRA + ABS data** drive professional registration verification

## Status

✅ **Fully populated** as of 2026-04-25.
**Coverage check**: pricing (CoreLogic + ABS), traffic, tax (extreme state divergence), rental (state RTA), work, risks (bushfire + flood + cyclone + earthquake), mains all have primary government sources + cost benchmarks + caveats.
**Confidence**: HIGH for CoreLogic Mar 2026 indices + foreign-buyer ban (1 Apr 2025 - 31 Mar 2027 confirmed) + foreign owner surcharges (NSW 9%, VIC 8%, QLD 8% confirmed) + VIC VRLT + Short-Stay Levy 7.5% + QLD Form 1 (1 Aug 2025); MEDIUM for post-2027 FIRB review.
