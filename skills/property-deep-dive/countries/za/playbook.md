### Price benchmarks (R/m², 2025 data — rates may have changed since)

Listing-derived ranges, cross-checked against FNB HPI (Q4 2024 / Q1 2025 releases). **Listing-trust caveat**: asking ≠ realised; Deeds Office search per erf gives true sale.

| Location | Listing R/m² (premium) | Source basis |
|---|---:|---|
| Clifton / Bantry Bay / Camps Bay (Atlantic Seaboard, Cape Town) | R60,000–R150,000+ | Property24 + Pam Golding listings, Q1 2025 |
| Sea Point / Green Point | R40,000–R80,000 | Property24 listings, Q1 2025 |
| Cape Town CBD / De Waterkant | R35,000–R60,000 | Property24 listings, Q1 2025 |
| Constantia / Bishopscourt (Southern Suburbs) | R30,000–R70,000 | Pam Golding, Q1 2025 |
| Stellenbosch town | R25,000–R55,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Sandton / Bryanston / Hyde Park (JHB) | R20,000–R60,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Houghton / Rosebank / Melrose (JHB) | R18,000–R45,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Johannesburg CBD / Maboneng | R8,000–R18,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Umhlanga / Ballito (KZN coastal) | R20,000–R45,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Durban North / Berea | R12,000–R25,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Durban CBD | R6,000–R14,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |
| Pretoria East / Waterkloof / Brooklyn | R12,000–R28,000 | Property24, Q1 2025 |

### Compute

1. Listing R/m² = listing price / advertised m² (clarify: floor area vs erf size — listings often quote both; **erf = land plot, floor area = built**)
2. Cross-check FNB HPI YoY for the metro (FNB releases monthly area indices)
3. For accurate transacted price: paid Lightstone or Deeds Office search per erf
4. **Trap**: sectional title listings sometimes exclude "exclusive use areas" (parking, garden) from the section's m² — verify against sectional title plan
5. **Trap**: foreigners purchasing for speculative letting now sometimes face seller "non-resident pricing premium" — anecdotal

## Section: `--traffic`

### Primary sources

- **SANRAL** (South African National Roads Agency Ltd) — national routes (N-routes, R-routes managed nationally): `https://www.nra.co.za/` (open-data traffic counts limited; ITS sites publish monthly)
- **Provincial DOTs** — regional roads:
  - Western Cape: `https://www.westerncape.gov.za/mobility`
  - Gauteng: `https://www.gauteng.gov.za/`
  - KZN: `https://www.kzntransport.gov.za/`
- **Municipal traffic depts** for urban: City of Cape Town TDA (Transport Directorate); City of Johannesburg JRA (Johannesburg Roads Agency); eThekwini ETA
- **OSM fallback**: `highway` tag for class (motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary, residential)

### Coarse fallback (OSM `highway`)

- `motorway` = N-route (e.g., N1, N2, N3) — 30,000–150,000 vehicles/day typical
- `trunk` = major R-route (R21, R24) — 15,000–50,000 v/d
- `primary` = secondary R-route — 5,000–20,000 v/d
- `secondary` = arterial suburban — 2,000–10,000 v/d
- `tertiary` = local connector — 500–3,000 v/d
- `residential` = quiet street — < 500 v/d

### Verdict bands

- 🟢 < 1,000 v/d (suburban residential)
- 🟡 1,000–5,000 v/d (urban side street, suburban arterial)
- 🟠 5,000–20,000 v/d (busy R-route, urban main road)
- 🔴 > 20,000 v/d (N-route, major urban arterial)

**Caveat**: SANRAL parcel-level AADT not in a single open dataset; for premium/decision-grade, request from provincial DOT directly. OSM class is reliable for tier; absolute volumes are estimates.

## Section: `--tax`

### Transfer Duty (one-time, buyer pays) — SARS Schedule 8

**Source**: SARS Transfer Duty: `https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/transfer-duty/` — verify current brackets at filing.

**2025/26 tax year brackets** (effective **1 April 2025**, per SARS — 2026-05-27 verified, source: SARS Latest News "New Transfer Duty rates effective 1 April 2025"):

| Property value (ZAR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| R0 – R1,210,000 | **0 %** |
| R1,210,001 – R1,663,800 | 3 % of value above R1,210,000 |
| R1,663,801 – R2,329,300 | R13,614 + 6 % above R1,663,800 |
| R2,329,301 – R2,994,800 | R53,544 + 8 % above R2,329,300 |
| R2,994,801 – R13,310,000 | R106,784 + 11 % above R2,994,800 |
| R13,310,001 + | R1,241,456 + 13 % above R13,310,000 |

(Source: SARS Transfer Duty 2025/26 Budget — verify at https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/transfer-duty/)

### VAT 15 %

- If seller is a **VAT vendor** (e.g., developer of new property), price is **VAT-inclusive at 15 %**, AND **no Transfer Duty** is payable (one or the other, not both)
- If seller is private (most resales), Transfer Duty applies, no VAT
- **2025 Budget proposed VAT rise 15 % → 15.5 % from 1 May 2025; withdrawn 24 Apr 2025**, VAT remained at 15 %. Contracts signed Mar–Apr 2025 with VAT rate-change clauses should be reviewed (2026-05-27 verified, source: National Treasury Media Statement 24 Apr 2025).

### Municipal Rates (annual, owner pays) — per municipality, set by tariff resolution each July

**Source**: each municipality publishes annual Tariffs document. Verify on city's official site each year.

| Municipality | Residential rate (cents/Rand of valuation) | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| **City of Cape Town** | ~0.6055 c/R (2024/25) | `https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-property-rates-and-valuations` |
| **City of Johannesburg** | ~0.7 c/R (2024/25) | `https://joburg.org.za/services_/Pages/City%20Services/Rates%20and%20Taxes/Rates-and-Tax.aspx` |
| **eThekwini (Durban)** | ~0.95–1.0 c/R (2024/25) | `https://www.durban.gov.za/uploads/0000/6/2025/09/22/ethekwini-municipality-property-rates-policy-2025-2026.pdf` |
| **City of Tshwane (Pretoria)** | ~0.93 c/R (2024/25) | `https://www.tshwane.gov.za/?page_id=6924` |
| **Ekurhuleni** | ~0.85 c/R (2024/25) | `https://www.ekurhuleni.gov.za/` |

(2024/25 data — **rates may have changed since July 2025 tariff cycle**; verify current at each municipality's tariff page.)

**Computation**: each municipality applies an **impermissible value** threshold (first ~R350,000 typically exempt for primary residence in Cape Town; ~R200,000 est. in JHB — verify JHB rates policy) before the rate. The Municipal Property Rates Act 6 of 2004 governs the framework.

**Example** — R5,000,000 home in Cape Town (2024/25):
- Taxable value: R5,000,000 − R350,000 = R4,650,000
- Annual rates: R4,650,000 × 0.006055 = **~R28,156/yr (~R2,346/month)**
- Plus refuse + sewer + water utility tariffs (separate)

### Capital Gains Tax (CGT) — seller, on disposal

- 40 % inclusion rate × marginal income tax rate (max 45 %) → **max effective CGT 18 %**
- **Primary residence exclusion**: first **R2,000,000** of gain excluded (per SARS) — applies only if used as primary residence
- Source: SARS CGT: `https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/capital-gains-tax/`

### Section 35A — Non-resident seller withholding

- For sales where the price is **R2,000,000 or more** to non-resident sellers (i.e., ≥ R2m, applies to the **full purchase price** — not only the portion above R2m), conveyancer must withhold (rates per SARS s35A, amended 22 Feb 2017; 2026-05-27 verified):
  - **7.5 %** if seller is natural person
  - **10 %** if seller is company
  - **15 %** if seller is trust
- Withheld amount paid to SARS within **14 days** if purchaser is resident, **28 days** if purchaser is non-resident; offset against final CGT on assessment.
- Seller may apply to SARS for a **directive** for a reduced or zero rate (e.g., exempt, low income, disposal at a loss) under the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 (TAA).
- Source: SARS s35A guide IT-PP-02-G01 + Non-resident sellers page: `https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/capital-gains-tax/non-resident-sellers-of-immovable-property/`

### Estate Duty

- 20 % above R3,500,000 abatement; 25 % on portion above R30,000,000
- Surviving-spouse abatement: any unused portion rolls over (effective abatement R7,000,000 for second-dying spouse if first-dying used none)
- Source: SARS Estate Duty: `https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/estate-duty/`

### Conveyancer / attorney fees (recommended Law Society guideline tariff — not statutory)

For R2M–R5M property: typically **R20,000–R50,000** (excluding VAT, Deeds Office reg, and bond reg)

### Total transaction cost (buyer side, 2025/26)

For an R3,000,000 cash purchase (no bond), Cape Town:
- Transfer Duty (R3M): R106,784 + 11 % × (R3,000,000 − R2,994,800) = **R107,356** (R3,000,000 falls in the R2,994,801–R13,310,000 bracket)
- Conveyancer transfer fees: ~R28,000 + VAT
- Deeds Office reg: ~R1,000
- FICA / disbursements: ~R2,000
- **Total: ~R140,000 (~4.7 % of price)**

For same R3M with 80 % bond:
- Above + bond registration attorney: ~R28,000 + VAT
- Bank initiation fee: ~R6,000
- Bond registration Deeds Office: ~R1,500
- **Total: ~R180,000 (~6.0 %)**

## Section: `--rental`

### Long-term residential rentals

**Governing law**:
- **Rental Housing Act 50 of 1999** (national framework + Provincial Rental Housing Tribunals for disputes)
- **Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008** (consumer-facing tenants)
- **Common law** (lease principles)

**Key obligations**:
- Written lease required if either party requests
- **Deposit**: must be held in **interest-bearing trust account** (interest accrues to tenant on return); refund within 7 days if no claims, or 14 days with itemised deductions
- **Inspection**: joint at move-in AND move-out, written report
- Notice: typically 1 calendar month for both parties
- Eviction: PIE Act 19 of 1998 (Prevention of Illegal Eviction) — court order required, lengthy

**Tax treatment**:
- Rental income reported on **ITR12** (annual return) and **IRP6** (provisional tax twice yearly)
- Deductible expenses: rates, levies, insurance, repairs (not improvements), bond interest, agent commission, water/electricity if owner-paid
- Net rental income added to taxable income at marginal rate (max 45 % for 2025/26 above ~R1,817,000 — top-bracket threshold est., verify SARS personal income-tax brackets table)
- Source: SARS Rental Income: `https://www.sars.gov.za/individuals/i-am-a-property-investor/`

### Short-term rentals (STR / Airbnb)

**Status**: in regulatory transition.

- **STR regulatory state of play (2026-05-27 verified)**: the **2019 Tourism Amendment Bill** (Hanekom) has been **shelved**; the successor instrument is the **Draft Code of Good Practice for Short-Term Rentals** gazetted by Tourism Minister Patricia de Lille in **March 2026** (60-day public comment closed **12 May 2026**) — currently **non-binding** but signals registration is the direction of travel under the Tourism Act 3 of 2014; a new **Tourism Amendment Bill** is estimated to reach **Cabinet during the 2026/27 financial year** (per Dept of Tourism briefing to the Portfolio Committee on Tourism, PMG `https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/42612`, 2026-07-02). Aug 2023 MoU between Airbnb + Dept of Tourism on a national STR database remains operative. **TOMSA Levy** (1 % voluntary, on accommodation tariff excl. VAT) managed by TBCSA; not a statutory tax. **No national statutory tourism tax exists** as of May 2026. Verify at `https://www.tourism.gov.za/`. Source: dearsouthafrica bill tracker; Lexology critical overview; Financial Mail 2026-04-09.
- **City of Cape Town (2026-07-02 verified)**: the **Municipal Planning By-Law (MPBL 2015 + amendments) already permits short-term letting**, so a zoning change is generally **not** required (a temporary departure from land-use rights / consent-use application may still apply in specific zones — treat as a per-erf caveat, not the default). The active 2026 levers are **rates + registration**: (1) a **2026/27 Rates Policy amendment** (tabled in Council **31 Mar 2026**, public comment to **30 Apr 2026** as part of the draft City budget; Council adoption **scheduled May 2026**, implementation **from 1 Jul 2026**) **reclassifies any property available for STR >50% of any 365-day period as commercial** rather than residential for rating (stays commercial until availability falls below 50% within a 365-day period); commercial reclassification of identified properties is **foreseen only from 1 Jul 2027** after a grace period. (2) a **mandatory STR registration system** (City-issued registration number for every property listed on an online booking platform) to be legislated via a **Short-Term Letting By-Law later in 2026**. Source: City of Cape Town Short-Term Letting FAQs `https://resource.capetown.gov.za/cityassets/Media%20Centre%20Assets/CCT-short-term-letting-FAQs.pdf`.
- **Body Corporate / HOA** (sectional title or estate): often **forbid STR** in the rules / conduct rules — verify sectional title management rules + conduct rules BEFORE buying for STR purpose
- **CSOS dispute forum**: residents can complain to Community Schemes Ombud Service if neighbour STR violates scheme rules

**Tax treatment for STR**:
- If casual / occasional → standard rental treatment (ITR12)
- If full-time professional → may be classified as "trade" → taxed as business income; consider PTY Ltd structure
- VAT registration mandatory if turnover > R1,000,000/12 months (compulsory) — verify SARS VAT thresholds

**Strategic notes**:
- Cape Town summer (Dec–Feb) peak; Atlantic Seaboard yields highest in country
- Garden Route (Knysna, Plett), KZN North Coast (Ballito, Umhlanga) seasonal
- Body Corporate consent the silent killer — many sectional title schemes ban STR via rule changes (CSOS-validated)
- Crime / safety perception affects demand — security infrastructure (alarms, electric fence, armed response) listed as features

### National / municipal water + sanitation

- **City of Cape Town Water & Sanitation**: `https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-water-and-sanitation-services`
- **Joburg Water (City of Johannesburg)**: `https://www.johannesburgwater.co.za/`
- **eThekwini Water and Sanitation**: `https://www.durban.gov.za/page/water-and-sanitation-services`
- **City of Tshwane**: `https://www.tshwane.gov.za/?page_id=6924`
- **Ekurhuleni Water**: `https://www.ekurhuleni.gov.za/`
- **Department of Water and Sanitation**: `https://www.dws.gov.za/`

### Verification

1. Check property's municipal account / rates statement — names water + sanitation service line
2. Listing language:
   - "municipal water + sewer" = mains both
   - "borehole + septic" = none on mains
   - "borehole + sewer" = mains sewer only (rural-urban edge)
3. **Most urban erfs in metro municipalities have full mains** (water + sewer); peri-urban smallholdings often borehole + septic; rural farms usually borehole + septic + own electricity arrangements

### Eskom load-shedding

- **Status**: declined sharply from 2024 peak (Stage 6) to mostly Stage 0–1 through 2025; intermittent stages return periodically — verify current at `https://www.eskom.co.za/distribution/loadshedding/` or EskomSePush app
- **Solar / inverter / battery backup** still common upgrade despite improved supply; cost R80,000–R300,000 typical install (5–10 kWh battery + inverter ± solar PV)
- **Section 12B / 12BA tax allowance** for renewable energy (business) — verify with SARS

## Caveats unique to ZA

- **BEC risk (Hawarden v ENS, [2024] ZASCA 90, 10 Jun 2024)** — Supreme Court of Appeal held conveyancers owe **no duty of care** to non-client buyers to warn of business email compromise; buyer bears the wire-fraud risk. Ms Hawarden lost ZAR 5.5m to a fraudster-substituted bank-detail letter. **Before any wire to a conveyancer trust account, phone-verify bank details against an independently-sourced number** (firm's switchboard listed on the Legal Practice Council roll, not the email signature). Foreign buyers wiring from offshore particularly exposed. ConCourt application pending. Source: SAFLII `https://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2024/90.html` (2026-05-27 verified).
- **CIPC Beneficial Ownership filing regime** (General Laws Amendment Act 22 of 2022) — any company/CC holding the property must file BO with CIPC within 30 days of anniversary alongside annual return; from **1 Jul 2024 CIPC hard-stops annual returns without BO compliance**; anyone with **>5 % beneficial interest** must be disclosed; non-compliance blocks annual returns and risks deregistration → cloud on title. Final reminder issued 21 Jul 2025. Verify at `https://www.cipc.co.za/?p=20495` (2026-05-27 verified).
- **Crime / safety per-suburb** verification critical — never rely on metro-level stats; pull SAPS quarterly per police station + walk the area at night before buying. ADT / Fidelity / Chubb armed-response coverage near-mandatory in JHB / parts of Cape Town
- **Load-shedding + backup power costs** — even with 2025 improvement, plan R100k–R300k for solar/inverter/battery if working from home is critical
- **Body Corporate health (sectional title)** — request 3 years of Annual General Meeting minutes + audited financials + reserve fund (10 yr Maintenance Plan mandatory under STSMA s. 3); special-levy risk if reserve under-funded
- **FICA proof of source of funds** — conveyancer will require bank statements, tax clearance, ID / passport copies; non-residents need apostilled docs + foreign bank statements
- **Non-resident 7.5 % S35A withholding** on sale > R2M (10 % company / 15 % trust) — paid to SARS by conveyancer; offset on assessment
- **Conveyancer mandatory** — only an admitted attorney with conveyancing certificate can lodge transfer at Deeds Office; buyer chooses but seller often prescribes
- **Beetle / Electrical / Plumbing CoCs at sale** — non-negotiable for lender finance; budget remediation
- **Expropriation Act 13 of 2024** — Constitutional Court watch; **practical urban residential risk remains very low** (Act narrowly targets unused land, derelict properties, agrarian reform), but theoretical risk should be disclosed to foreign buyers; full text + status: `https://www.gov.za/documents/acts`
- **Coastal Beetle borer** — endemic W. Cape + KZN; treatment cost can run R20,000–R100,000+ for full-roof fumigation
- **Cape water security** — improved post-Day-Zero (2018) via desal, aquifer extraction, demand management; on-watch in extended droughts
- **Sinkhole / dolomite zones** (JHB West Rand, Centurion, parts of Pretoria) — CGS Dolomite Stability Map essential pre-purchase; in worst zones building permits restricted
- **KZN April flood pattern** — 2022 + 2024 events catastrophic; insurance now loaded for floodplain properties

## Quirks to know

- **Title Deed is sole evidence of ownership** — there is NO title insurance market in ZA (unlike US); Deeds Registry is state-guaranteed
- **SG diagram link**: every erf has a SG diagram registered separately — verify boundary matches what seller claims
- **Body Corporate vs HOA**: sectional title schemes have a Body Corporate (statutory under STSMA); estates / share-block schemes typically HOA (contractual under Articles); different governance + dispute paths
- **Special Levies clause**: review last 3 yrs AGM minutes for hints of impending special levy (roof, lift, painting cycles)
- **Beetle / electrical / plumbing CoCs** mandatory at sale — see Risks section
- **CSOS dispute forum**: cheaper / faster than High Court for body corporate / HOA disputes; both parties bound by adjudication
- **FICA enforcement**: South Africa was on FATF "grey list" 2023; FICA enforcement intensified — expect lengthy KYC for non-residents
- **Expropriation Act 2024** still evolving — Constitutional Court challenges pending (DA, AfriForum); practical urban residential expropriation extremely rare; theoretical risk should be disclosed
- **SARS S35A non-resident withholding** — the 7.5 / 10 / 15 % is INTERIM; final CGT liability assessed on tax return; reclaim possible if over-withheld
- **Loadshedding language**: "Stages" (1–8) refer to MW shed; "Stage 4" ≈ 4–8 hr/day cuts in 2 hr blocks per area schedule
- **Ekurhuleni includes OR Tambo Airport** — may impact noise / flight-path properties
- **Foreign buyer mortgage cap**: typically **50 % LTV for non-resident foreigners** without SA work visa; **70–90 % LTV** for resident foreigners with valid visa (varies by lender — verify with FNB / Standard Bank / Absa / Nedbank / Investec; offshore-funds verification adds 4–8 weeks)
